They share what they find helpful on 1Cademy and meet on a weekly basis to discuss their topics of interest. We learn about state-of-the-art topics that our collaborators research/learn at their institutions, and find connections that help us form new research ideas.",

Whoever finds an easier way to define/explain a concept, they propose it on 1Cademy and the community decides which method is more effective to learn that concept. This way, over time, learning through 1Cademy gets more effective and enjoyable.",

    name: "Developing Learning Pathways",
    body: "Whatever topic one wants to learn is explained somewhere on the Web, but we still pay for textbooks and courses because they provide us with learning pathways (i.e. step-by-step procedures to achieve our learning objectives.) However, textbooks and courses have only a few authors, and they are difficult to update/improve. 1Cademy provides a platform for students, instructors, and researchers to collaboratively design learning pathways on every topic on a single shared knowledge graph.",

We summarize and visualize our learning pathways on 1Cademy for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of our collaborators' learning. Along the way, we deepen our understanding of the topics through thinking how to make them easier to learn for others.",

For example, what would you search to learn to develop web animations like those you see on this website? Just "web animations"? Well, that does not really help you find the right content to learn from. 1Cademy provides us with a search engine for "factual search," in addition to a mechanism to develop a personalized view of the shared knowledge graph to facilitate "exploratory search." This way, even without having the right keywords, we can navigate through the hierarchical structure of the concepts and their prerequisite links to learn.`,

Echo chambers are formed where a group of people only accept thoughts and ideas that are aligned with their perspectives, ignoring alternatives views. 1Cademy provides us with a consensus-based collaboration mechanism where alternative or even competing perspectives are placed side-by-side so that one can easily compare and contrast them to learn and rationalize each topic in different contexts.",
