We have multiple successful communities from various fields collaborating regularly by summarizing and organizing content on the platform. This community is focused on learning how to make healthier, more engaged online communities in order to improve our usersâ€™ learning, contributions, and experience.
      The UX Research in Online Communities team is dedicated to uncovering, presenting, and compiling the latest literature and research on creating and maintaining engaging and beneficial online communities. Our goal is to understand how to foster online communities where users actively contribute their ideas and value the perspectives of their peers. We are seeking a team of dedicated students to conduct thorough research in various disciplines including psychology, social science, cognitive science, information science, and economics. Utilizing the 1Cademy platform, we will take notes, organize ideas, and map concepts from the literature we find. Ultimately, our aim is to apply our findings to make meaningful improvements to the 1Cademy platform and enhance the user experience of our online communities.

We encourage interns to dive into research that they have particular interest in (e.g., child psychopathology), share their findings, and collaborate with other interns. This internship is designed to motivate independent research, gain research skills such as analysis and interpretation, and work towards conducting research.
          1Cademy allows interns to present their research findings, gain feedback from other interns, and learn how to communicate their findings in a concise and articulate manner.`,

Using credible, scholarly articles, we are exploring various topics within the field of health psychology, including: behavioral therapies for mental illness, the intersection of race and gender in the healthcare industry, what motivates people to maintain a healthy lifestyle, and the complex role of the media in health. As we compile our research using 1Cademy, we hope to discover patterns and gaps in the literature that could be addressed in a future study of our own design. Each week, interns read an article, summarize it using 1Cademy, present their findings to the group, and engage in thoughtful discussion about themes present in their article.",

Our team members will dive into these papers and present what they've been learning throughout each week by walking us through the nodes they have designed during our weekly team meetings.
