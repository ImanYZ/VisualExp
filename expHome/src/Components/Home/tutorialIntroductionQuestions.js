          Say you want to learn a new topic, like data science. Where would you start? Do you look at available courses?
          Books? Videos? Something else? After that, what do you do next? Because there is a vast amount of knowledge on
          the internet, trying to learn a new topic online can be like a scavenger hunt and jumping from source to
          source is tough, overwhelming, and tiresome.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whatever topic someone would want to learn is explained somewhere on the web, but we still pay for textbooks
          and courses because they provide us with learning pathways. However, these only have a few authors, and are
          difficult to improve or update.
        </p>
        <p>
          1Cademy provides a platform for students, instructors, and researchers to collaboratively design learning
          pathways on every topic on a single shared knowledge graph. 1Cademy is an interactive learning and research
          community that's crowdsourced by all kinds of different schools and disciplines. These disciplines make up the
          many research communities in 1Cademy with students and researchers from a large number of schools and research
          institutions. These researchers and students share what they find helpful on 1Cademy and meet on a weekly
          basis to discuss their topics of interest.
        </p>
        <img src="/static/tutorial/1CademyIntroductionFundamentals.png" width="100%" />
        <p>
          We learn about state-of-the-art topics and find connections that help us form new research ideas. With a
          node-based knowledge map system, 1Cademy helps us start learning from advanced topics and go backwards through
          the prerequisites as needed. This is how researchers start learning new topics. They specify targets and only
          learn those prerequisites that are necessary to help them achieve their objectives
        </p>
        <p>
          Each node contains a single block of information. Just summarize, cite the sources, and submit. Nodes can then
          be linked to other nodes, to link the highest level concepts of a topic down to its most richly detailed
          nuance. 1Cademy allows users to develop a personalized view of the shared knowledge graph to facilitate
          exploratory search. This way users can still navigate through concepts and their prerequisites to learn
          without having to look up key terms they may not know.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everything on 1Cademy gets peer-reviewed and users vote on each node for its accuracy and dependability - the
          more upvotes the better. If a node is downvoted enough, users can propose changes, give it an overhaul, or
          remove it entirely. 1Cademy members are constantly evaluating the effectiveness of content and learning
          pathways. If someone believes they've found an easier way to explain a concept, they propose it on 1Cademy and
          the community decides which method is more effective. This way over time, learning through 1Cademy gets easier
          because any time you may second guess your learning the whole community has your back.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, everything you do on 1Cademy is reflected through the reputation point system. Climb to the top of
          your community's leaderboard by helping others learn more effectively and in turn deepening your own
          knowledge. Every section of 1Cademy encourages fairness and accuracy. Now imagine that new topic you want to
          study. Doesn't the pathway for learning sound so much easier through 1Cademy? Come join this rapidly evolving
          community of researchers on your pathway to success.

          1Cademy’s personalized knowledge map view is a visualization of certain nodes and prerequisite links between
          them which is hierarchically organized and personalized for a specific 1Cademy user. The personalized
          knowledge map supports four overarching learning activities: navigation, summarization, evaluation, and
          improvement.
        </p>

          Every user's personalized knowledge map view will be different and unique to them. If you choose to hide a
          node from your map, your personalized knowledge map view will change. It is important to note that closing or
          hiding a node on your knowledge map will not affect another user's map. Your personalized knowledge map can
          look like anything you would like it to. If you prefer to have very little nodes in view, you can do that. If
          you would rather have many nodes open, you can choose to leave as many nodes open as you would like on your
          map (examples of different knowledge maps shown in video). There are endless ways in which your personalized
          knowledge map view can be organized, it just depends on what you personally like.

        <p>
          We are going to go over the 10 different ways you can open up a node on your personalized view of the
          knowledge map.
        </p>
        <p>
          <p>
            1. Using the search function you can search for any key term on the map. If a node has the term in its
            title, it will show up in the results. Click on a result to open up that node
          </p>
          <p>
            2. You can use your notifications tab to track any updates made to nodes you've contributed to. To open up a
            node that someone has voted on or edited, you can click on the notification.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. If you've bookmarked any nodes, when a change is made to the bookmarked node it will show up in the
            bookmarked updates tab and you can click on it directly to open it on your map.
          </p>
          <p>
            4. The pending list will show all of the pending proposals within your tag. If you open the pending
            proposals bar, you will see pending proposals listed. Click on one to open up the node which the pending
            proposal was made to.
          </p>
          <p>
            5. You can also use the chat feature to link nodes so that people can easily access them. Any user of
            1Cademy can easily open up a linked node sent in the chat.
          </p>
          <p>
            6. Another way to open up nodes is by going to a user profile by clicking on a profile picture in the
            leaderboard. Once the profile loads, you can scroll down to see all of the past proposals this user has
            made. You can click on any proposal to open up that node.
          </p>
          <p>
            7. On any of your open nodes, you can click to view the parent links. To open parents, go to the button
            underneath the parents or prerequisites section of a node and click on it.
          </p>
          <p>
            8. On any of your open nodes, you can click to view the child links. To open the children, you can either
            select one of the children listed in the children section of the node or you can select the “All children”
            button to open up all of them.
          </p>
          <p>
            9. You can also go to the tags and citations section to open up the node that contains the reference. Click
            on the title listed under “References” to open up the reference node.
          </p>
          <p>
            10. To open up the tag for a node, go to the tags and citation section of a node and click on any of the
            tags listed under the “Tags” section.{" "}

          Having a profile picture increases your social presence within 1Cademy, therefore it is recommended (but not

          In this section, we are going to go over marking a node as studied and bookmarking. These two functions are
          intertwined as marking a node as studied will affect your bookmarks. Marking a node as studied can be a great
          way to track your progress as you navigate through the 1Cademy map. Any unstudied node on the map will have a
          red border (this is the default state). When you have gone over a node's content and feel confident with the
          information, you can click on the envelope icon in the node footer and the border will turn yellow, therefore
          marking it as studied. It is important to note that if a node you marked as studied is changed in any way, it
          will default back to the not studied state with a red border.
        </p>
        <img src="/static/tutorial/BookmarkingandMarkingNodesasStudied1.png" width="100%" />
        <img src="/static/tutorial/BookmarkingandMarkingNodesasStudied2.png" width="100%" />
        <p>
          This is why bookmarking can be important because it will help you keep track of nodes that you like that have
          been updated. When you have found a node on the map that you think is particularly useful, you can bookmark it
          to be notified of any proposed changes. To bookmark a node, click on the banner icon in the node footer. Any
          changes to a bookmarked node are reflected in the “bookmarked updates” tab in the sidebar that is to the left
          of the screen.
        </p>
        <img src="/static/tutorial/BookmarkingandMarkingNodesasStudied3.png" width="100%" />
        <p>
          A node will only appear in the bookmarked updates tab when it is marked as not studied. To easily navigate to
          a node in your bookmarked updates tab, click on the node title. Once you have reviewed the changes that have
          been made to the node you can mark the node as studied again it will disappear from the bookmarked updates tab
          (until it is edited again). If you do not want to have a node bookmarked anymore, you can simply click on the
          banner icon again.

          To change your 1Cademy community membership, the first thing you will need to do is to make sure the node you
          want to tag your community membership as is open on your map. If it is not, you can easily use the search
          function to perform a keyword search and open it up. Once you have the default tag open on your map, you can
          now change your community membership by first going to user profile and clicking on your community membership
          or tag.{" "}

          After you click this button, you will see a prompt in red that says “click the node you would like to link

          of your user profile, you will see that your leaderboard in the sidebar also reflects this change.

          There are many icons and buttons along the node footer. First, on the far left you will see the top

          that, you will see the adjust node height button. You can select this when your nodes are overlapping and you
          cannot read your content. To the right of that, you will see the narration button. Select this to have the
          node content read out loud for you. After the narration button, there is the version history button with the
          calendar icon. When you select this, a sidebar will pop up showing you all the previous versions and edits
          proposed on a node. You can also see when the last edit was made next to the calendar icon.

          The pencil button will allow you to edit the node’s content directly or add a child node. The number next to
          the pencil indicates how many different proposed edits have been made to this node. Next you will see the tags
          and citations button. If you click this, you will be able to see the references and the different tags

          To the right of that you will see the downvote button. If you find that a node is not organized properly,
          inaccurate, or unhelpful, you can vote to delete it. Alternatively, the upvote button will allow you to vote
          to prevent further changes. You should use this for nodes that you find helpful. Note that up/downvoting a
          node directly impacts all the accepted proposals in the edit history of the node, proportionally based on
          their total upvotes minus downvotes. This consequently impacts the reputation points of the users who
          contributed those proposals. This is because in the history of evolution of a node, each accepted proposal has
          contributed to the extent that it has received upvotes minus downvotes and users' expressions of
          helpfulness/unhelpfulness of each nodes should impact all the proposals that have contributed to the evolution
          of the node.

        <p>
          Learning the difference between concept nodes and relation nodes on 1Cademy is one of the biggest challenges
          while proposing content on the knowledge graph. So, here are a few methods for figuring out whether a new node
          you are proposing should be a concept or a relation node. The first step is to think through what layout your
          node will have. Many relation nodes will be in the form of bulleted lists while concept nodes will most be be
          in paragraph form. However, this is not always the case as every once in a while you will have a bulleted list
          that is actually a concept node or a relation node that is in paragraph form. So even though knowing the the
          layout of your node can help in a terms of a realizing whether it is a concept node or a relation node, there
          are still more steps and critical thing necessary to truly nail down what type of node your node should be.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second step is to think through what the purpose of your node will be. If the node exists to introduce a
          new piece of information onto the map, it is a concept node. While all child nodes are related to their parent
          node, concept nodes define or describe a piece of information that can stand on its own. For example, even
          though the node “homelessness and runaways” is informed by the node “library as a place” by a virtue of being
          its child, it still shows a singular piece of information that can exist on its own and thus is a concept
          node.
        </p>
        <img src="/static/tutorial/RelationNodesvsConceptNodes1.png" width="100%" />
        <p>
          However, a relation node will reflect either how two or more nodes are connected to one another. Or, if it is
          a bulleted list, all of the bullets will relate to one another as a function of what the what the node is
          attempting to communicate. So if either of those cases are a true, then that is a a good sign that your node
          will be a relation node.
        </p>
        <img src="/static/tutorial/RelationNodesvsConceptNodes2.png" width="100%" />
        <p>
          However, there are cases where a node with the layout and purpose of a concept node are still a relation node
          so more evaluation and critical thinking about the node may still be necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          The final step and perhaps the most difficult, is to understand the transformative nature of the node you are
          proposing. What this means is if adding the node changes the meaning or conceptualization of the nodes that
          come before it. For example adding a concept node after a parent node does not change anything about the
          meaning of the parent node or how we conceptualize it. However, a relation node is transformative and will
          change our conceptualization of its parent nodes. For an example, we examine the node “Contested Definitions
          of Non-Formal and Informal Education” (shown in video). At first glance, it may seem like a concept node. It
          has the layout most often ascribed to concept nodes and it shows a singular idea that arguably can stand on
          its own. However, what makes it a relation node is its transformative nature. Through this node, the
          conceptualization of its parents, that being “non-formal education” and “informal education,” is changed and
          the node itself shows a relationship between the definitions of non-formal and informal education. So, in
          fact, the “Contested Definitions of Non-Formal and Informal Education” node is a relation node. This is
          definitely the most difficult way to comprehend the difference between concept and and relation nodes and is
          the one that requires the most critical thinking, but it is the most useful especially when you are proposing
          a node that arguably could either be a concept or a relation node.

          In this video, we discuss reference nodes. A reference node contains a single citation that references a
          source used to summarize information. On 1Cademy, reference nodes cannot cite a book chapter, video section,
          or webpage.{" "}

        <p>
          The icon shown on the screen in the bottom corner of the node indicates the node type as a reference node.
          Reference nodes are always cited in an APA format. They include citations for videos, scholarly articles,
          books, websites, and audio.
        </p>

          So, to create a reference node, first you want to click the pencil icon to edit, then you are going to click
          reference child node. From there you are going to add the title, and in the content put your APA source. In
          the node, you can add your reason for adding the child reference node and ensure your tags are correct then

          As a single user, the first thing you need to do is make sure that you set your community tag. As you can see,
          mine is psychology and to change it I need to click on my profile picture and select the tag button. Here I've
          decided that I no longer want to be a part of the psychology community and that I'm going to switch to
          sociology. Once I click the button, you'll see that I'm prompted in red to click the node I would like to link
          to and I would like to link to sociology. Once it loads, you'll see an update on my profile and when I exit
          out of my profile you will also see it update on my sidebar.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Next thing I have to do is add a reference node, so first I have to identify where all the sociology
          references are, in this case, they are linked to the relation node sociology references. I select the propose
          version of this node and then pick the reference child node option and when I do I'll get a blank node that
          allows me to copy in the citation and the title
        </p>
        <img src="/static/tutorial/GettingStartedAsaUser1.png" width="100%" />
        <p>
          I've already added my reference node so I'm going to go ahead and cancel that. Now that I've added my
          citation, I'm going to look at the information I want to summarize. So, there are two different kinds of
          social structures, one is horizontal and one is vertical and I would like to add the horizontal social
          structure term to the map.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, I need to find the prerequisite link, the immediate prerequisite link, so starting out in sociology,
          I'm going to start opening children until I distill the information far enough where I find the immediate
          prerequisite. I see that sociological structures are already added as a child so I'm going to go ahead and
          open that and see what it has to offer. I see that sociological structures are the different structures that
          societies are organized in and they can either be classified as horizontal or vertical. This is exactly where
          I want to add my content, I'll look at the children that already exist just to make sure that the information
          I want to add is not already on the map. So, I'll click to view the parent and child nodes and I see that the
          horizontal social structure has not been added as a child yet. So, I'll propose an edit to add a concept node,
          because horizontal social structures is a concept, and I'll see a blank node pop up.
        </p>
        <img src="/static/tutorial/GettingStartedAsaUser2.png" width="100%" />
        <img src="/static/tutorial/GettingStartedAsaUser3.png" width="100%" />
        <p>
          You want to title your node as specifically, clearly, and concisely as possible. I'm going to just title the
          child node by what i'm defining, which is the horizontal social structure and then I need to define it in my
          own words. All content on 1Cademy should be paraphrased in your own words to help your learning and make sure
          that we're not actually plagiarizing. So the horizontal structure lets me refer to my source again, which is
          the social relationships and the social and physical characteristics of communities to which individuals
          belong. In my own words, I'm going to talk about how horizontal social structures refer to the relationships
          and communities that are connected to individuals.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the first draft of my node, later we'll talk about the peer review process and I'm counting on the
          other people in my community to come in and help me improve this node as best we can, but for now what i'm
          going to do is go ahead and cite my reference. All you have to do is click cite an existing reference and then
          select the reference node that you want to cite, also this is chapter 1.2 Understanding Society, so i'm going
          to specify the chapter, page number or the url that you want to use. I'm going to propose the node and I'll
          see that it now exists.

          To help you better understand the structure of information on 1Cademy, we are going to go over prerequisite
          linking. First, we're going to break down the term and then we will define it within the context of 1Cademy.
          Breaking down the term “prerequisite linking,” we see that “prerequisite” is the knowledge or information
          required before one can proceed to learning any new knowledge or information. So for example, you need to
          learn <strong>how to count</strong> (prerequisite information) before you can learn{" "}
          <strong>how to add</strong> (new information). Then, “linking” is defined as connecting one thing to something
          else - like moving from counting to adding.
        </p>
        <img src="/static/tutorial/PrerequisiteLinkingon1Cademy1.png" width="100%" />
        <p>
          When we put the terms together, we see that prerequisite linking is when new units of information are
          connected to foundational units of information. These foundational units need to be learned before one can
          move onto the new units.{" "}
        </p>
        <img src="/static/tutorial/PrerequisiteLinkingon1Cademy2.png" width="100%" />
        <p>
          Prerequisite linking on 1Cademy is defined as: the nodes are organized in a hierarchy where what is needed to
          learn a concept is connected as a parent node. Looking at an example on the 1Cademy map, you can see that you
          need to know what concepts are before learning what a conceptual model is, and you need to know what a
          conceptual model is before you can understand concept mapping. You will see that the parent nodes are linked
          on the left, and the green arrow denotes the child node linked on the right (example is explained in the
          video).

        <p>
          The first step in adding a new node to 1Cademy is finding the immediate prerequisite or the parent node. All
          parent nodes should contain the direct or immediate prerequisite information that a user needs to understand
          or learn through a follow-up child node. Users must first find or add the parent node that contains the
          immediate prerequisite information to the child node that they want to add.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          You can check to see if the immediate prerequisite already exists on the map or you can add or link the
          prerequisites that are necessary for the information that you want to add. First, do a search for the
          immediate prerequisite, using the search feature. You can watch the video by using the search feature on
          1Cademy to help you out. If you use a search feature you can perform a keyword search to look for terms that
          might be in an immediate prerequisite node.
        </p>
        <p>
          A user can also click through the links in the area that they want to add their node to and as they click
          through the links they might find that the immediate prerequisite already exists. If your immediate
          prerequisite does not already exist in your area of the map, or if it does exist somewhere else, what you're
          going to have to do is link it to your area of the map.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively, you could add a node to your area of the map and link your child node there. Sometimes, you
          will have to go through all the ancestor or all the prerequisites available within the topic. These ancestors
          may provide prerequisite information but they may not provide the direct or immediate prerequisite
          information, therefore, you should go through these nodes until you find the gap in knowledge and add your own
          prerequisites.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, the direct information needed for your new child node will now exist on the map. Those are the two main
          ways you can either look to see if an immediate prerequisite already exists, add or link your own
          prerequisites to make sure that your new child node has the direct prerequisite information it needs so that
          users can learn through the links on 1Cademy without any gaps in knowledge.

          To begin, I want to add the node open access publishing to the map. I searched for open access publishing and
          it doesn't show up, but open access does and I know that open access offers prerequisite knowledge to my
          proposed node.

          I click on open access to go to that node and here I can see what relationships it has by viewing the parent
          and child nodes. I can also navigate to this prerequisite node by browsing through the map.

          Let's start with the node, types of librarianship and move over to the academic librarianship node, as I think
          this is a common topic in that field, then we move to topics in Academic Librarianship, which takes us to open
          access. I need to know what open access is before I can understand the concept of open access publishing, so I
          want to add open access publishing as a child node to open access; however, after considering what open access
          entails I realize there are many other topics in open access. So, it would be better to add a child relation
          node to open access for topics and open access first. Alternatively, we could link any appropriate
          prerequisite that already exists on the map by editing that node to add open access as a parent once the
          knowledge gap is filled with the appropriate prerequisite nodes. Then, I can link my open access publishing
          node to the topics in the open access node as a child concept node.

          Once you make a proposal it will either be immediately accepted or sent to the pending proposals list. The
          route it takes depends on how many upvotes and downvotes there are for the edited node. The total number of
          downvotes is subtracted from the total number of upvotes. If this number is less than three, any proposals
          will automatically be accepted and if this number is three or more, such as with the Library Science node,
          which has eight upvotes and zeroes downvotes, the proposal will go to the pending proposals list.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pending proposal list is based on your community tag and can be found on the sidebar. In evaluating a
          pending proposal, click on the proposal in the pending list, the node that the proposal is for will pop up.
          Then, click propose/evaluate versions of this node, located at the bottom of the node, and click on the
          pending proposal you want to evaluate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evaluate whether you think the proposal is helpful or unhelpful by looking at the parent or ancestor nodes to
          understand the node you are editing. The proposal will be accepted when it receives a sum of upvotes minus
          downvotes equal to over half the sum of upvotes minus downvotes to the node it is changing. So, for the
          Focuses of Library Science node that has thirteen upvotes, any proposal will need to get seven upvotes to go
          through.{" "}

          Pending proposals cannot be downvoted off of the pending proposals list. To evaluate them, you should open the
          list of pending proposals on a specific node by clicking the pencil button on the node. Pending proposals will
          continue to get up or down votes until they either qualify as an accepted edit or the original creator deletes
          the proposal.

          Our communities care a lot about the integrity of the knowledge shared on 1Cademy. For this purpose, in
          addition to the community leaders who supervise your contributions to 1Cademy, we have a dedicated community
          of liaison librarians who supervise all communities to ensure cohesion of the content across 1Cademy
          communities. If you're not sure about the credibility of the sources that you'd like to summarize, please do
          one of the followings:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ask the 1Cademy liaison librarians working with your community.</li>

          Research papers are structured differently than a textbook. We want to ensure we know how to summarize
          research papers and apply that information when proposing nodes on 1Cademy. The general process for proposing
          new information to the platform is to find the appropriate area of the map. Then, propose a reference node for
          your source. Next, find the immediate prerequisite for the new content you'd like to add and propose your
          nodes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some considerations for research papers; make sure to summarize the paper's findings as discrete concepts and
          relations. You don't want to have multiple concepts all in the same node. You also don't need to propose a
          node for every section of the research paper. You don't need to have a methods node or an analysis node but
          include nodes based on the concepts rather than the structure of the paper. That means you don't need to
          summarize the entire paper when you're adding new content from it on the platform. Focus mostly on the
          findings, their discussion, and what they contributed to the body of knowledge for the field they’re studying.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, take a paper about teaching specifically about Dialogic Pedagogy. Pedagogy is an approach to
          teaching. Dialogic means discussion based. So, for this example, I would work in the education area on the
          1Cademy platform. Once you have found the specific topics your paper focuses on, use the search tool, or
          navigate through the nodes on the platform to find where your content will need to be added.
        </p>

        <p>
          The first thing you will add is a reference node. That way you can use this node when you're citing later
          nodes. Each broad topic on 1Cademy should have a reference parent node, and this is where you'll add the
          reference node for your paper. It is important to make sure you use APA format when you are adding this new
          reference node. Once you have done that, your next step is to find the specific nodes that will be the
          immediate prerequisite for the content you want to add. Make sure that you're not duplicating content that
          already exists on the map. If the immediate prerequisite that you need doesn't exist, then you can always
          propose it.
        </p>
        <img src="/static/tutorial/SummarizingaPaperon1Cademy2.png" width="100%" />
        <p>
          {" "}
          Your next step is to propose the nodes. Make sure that you are paraphrasing or summarizing information. We
          don't use direct quotes on 1Cademy. You also should be citing the page numbers for the paper when adding
          content for each node. Keep in mind what concepts the research paper is contributing to the larger body of
          knowledge for the field. For example, in the earlier mentioned pedagogy paper, what new concepts is the paper
          contributing to the field of education?
        </p>
        <img src="/static/tutorial/SummarizingaPaperon1Cademy3.png" width="100%" />
        <p>
          Still using the pedagogy paper as an example, on 1Cademy, there are no nodes about the pedagogy paper’s
          methods, specifically there are no nodes about the literature review. All of the information has been
          summarized conceptually. However, there is an immediate prerequisite node called Discussion in Education. The
          prerequisite already existed, so I did not need to create a prerequisite for myself. The paper went over
          several different features of discussion in education, discussing some theories of dialogic teaching. I then
          added some nodes after these child relation nodes about dialogism and sociocultural theory of learning. I
          found that the third theory it discusses, social constructivism, already exists and linked it to my relation
          node Theories of Dialogistic Teaching as a child node. I have also added nodes on the features of dialogic
          teaching and obstacles to dialogic teaching that the paper discusses, but I do not have any specific nodes
          based on the structure of the paper, only concepts proposed or discussed in the paper.
