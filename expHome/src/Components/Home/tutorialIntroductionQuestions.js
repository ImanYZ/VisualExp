         Say you want to learn a new topic, like data science. Where would you start? Do you look at available courses? Books? 
         Videos? Something else? After that, what do you do next? Because there is a vast amount of knowledge on the internet, 
         trying to learn a new topic online can be like a scavenger hunt and jumping from source to source is tough, overwhelming, and tiresome. 
         </p>
         <p>
         Whatever topic someone would want to learn is explained somewhere on the web, but we still pay for textbooks and courses because they provide us with learning pathways. 
         However, these only have a few authors, and are difficult to improve or update.
         </p>
         <p>
         1Cademy provides a platform for students, instructors, and researchers to collaboratively design learning pathways on every topic on a single shared knowledge graph. 
         1Cademy is an interactive learning and research community that's crowdsourced by all kinds of different schools and disciplines. These disciplines make up the many research communities in 1Cademy with students and researchers from a large number of schools and research institutions. 
         These researchers and students share what they find helpful on 1Cademy and meet on a weekly basis to discuss their topics of interest.
         </p>
         <img src="/static/tutorial/1CademyIntroductionFundamentals.png" width="100%" />
          <p>We learn about state-of-the-art topics and find connections that help us form new research ideas. 
            With a node-based knowledge map system, 1Cademy helps us start learning from advanced topics and go backwards through the prerequisites as needed. This is how researchers start learning new topics. 
          They specify targets and only learn those prerequisites that are necessary to help them achieve their objectives</p>
          <p>Each node contains a single block of information. Just summarize, cite the sources, and submit. 
            Nodes can then be linked to other nodes, to link the highest level concepts of a topic down to its most richly detailed nuance.
             1Cademy allows users to develop a personalized view of the shared knowledge graph to facilitate exploratory search. 
             This way users can still navigate through concepts and their prerequisites to learn without having to look up key terms they may not know.</p>
          <p>Everything on 1Cademy gets peer-reviewed and users vote on each node for its accuracy and dependability - the more upvotes the better.
             If a node is downvoted enough, users can propose changes, give it an overhaul, or remove it entirely. 1Cademy members are constantly evaluating the effectiveness of content and learning pathways.
              If someone believes they've found an easier way to explain a concept, they propose it on 1Cademy and the community decides which method is more effective.
             This way over time, learning through 1Cademy gets easier because any time you may second guess your learning the whole community has your back.</p>
         <p>Lastly, everything you do on 1Cademy is reflected through the reputation point system. Climb to the top of your community's leaderboard by helping others learn more effectively and in turn deepening your own knowledge. 
          Every section of 1Cademy encourages fairness and accuracy. Now imagine that new topic you want to study. Doesn't the pathway for learning sound so much easier through 1Cademy? Come join this rapidly evolving community of researchers on your pathway to success.</p>

         A concept node defines a single concept of information and its definition. Relation nodes compare and explain a relationship between two topics or explain the relationship relating to multiple concepts. Reference nodes display a cited source in an APA format. Idea nodes are new, original ideas that are not summarized from a external source or contain any needed citations. 
         Question nodes ask a multiple-choice question that user's answer by selecting the options provided.

         1Cademy’s personalized knowledge map view is a visualization of certain nodes and prerequisite links between them which is hierarchically organized and personalized for a specific 1Cademy user. The personalized knowledge map supports four overarching learning activities: navigation, summarization, evaluation, and improvement.
         </p>
         <p>
         Every user's personalized knowledge map view will be different and unique to them. If you choose to hide a node from your map, your personalized knowledge map view will change. It is important to note that closing or hiding a node on your knowledge map will not affect another user's map. Your personalized knowledge map can look like anything you would like it to. If you prefer to have very little nodes in view, you can do that. If you would rather have many nodes open, you can choose to leave as many nodes open as you would like on your map (examples of different knowledge maps shown in video). There are endless ways in which your personalized knowledge map view can be organized, it just depends on what you personally like.

         <p>1. Using the search function you can search for any key term on the map. If a node has the term in its title, it will show up in the results. Click on a result to open up that node</p>
         <p>2. You can use your notifications tab to track any updates made to nodes you've contributed to. To open up a node that someone has voted on or edited, you can click on the notification.</p>
         <p>3. If you've bookmarked any nodes, when a change is made to the bookmarked node it will show up in the bookmarked updates tab and you can click on it directly to open it on your map.</p>
         <p>4. The pending list will show all of the pending proposals within your tag. If you open the pending proposals bar, you will see pending proposals listed. Click on one to open up the node which the pending proposal was made to.</p>
         <p>5. You can also use the chat feature to link nodes so that people can easily access them. Any user of 1Cademy can easily open up a linked node sent in the chat.</p>
         <p>6. Another way to open up nodes is by going to a user profile by clicking on a profile picture in the leaderboard. Once the profile loads, you can scroll down to see all of the past proposals this user has made. You can click on any proposal to open up that node.</p>
         <p>7. On any of your open nodes, you can click to view the parent links. To open parents, go to the button underneath the parents or prerequisites section of a node and click on it.</p>
         <p>8. On any of your open nodes, you can click to view the child links. To open the children, you can either select one of the children listed in the children section of the node or you can select the “All children” button to open up all of them.</p>
         <p>9. You can also go to the tags and citations section to open up the node that contains the reference. Click on the title listed under “References” to open up the reference node.</p>

         In this section, we are going to go over marking a node as studied and bookmarking. These two functions are intertwined as marking a node as studied will affect your bookmarks. Marking a node as studied can be a great way to track your progress as you navigate through the 1Cademy map. Any unstudied node on the map will have a red border (this is the default state). When you have gone over a node's content and feel confident with the information, you can click on the envelope icon in the node footer and the border will turn yellow, therefore marking it as studied. It is important to note that if a node you marked as studied is changed in any way, it will default back to the not studied state with a red border. 
         </p>
         <img src="/static/tutorial/BookmarkingandMarkingNodesasStudied1.png" width="100%" />
         <img src="/static/tutorial/BookmarkingandMarkingNodesasStudied2.png" width="100%" />
         <p>
         This is why bookmarking can be important because it will help you keep track of nodes that you like that have been updated. When you have found a node on the map that you think is particularly useful, you can bookmark it to be notified of any proposed changes. To bookmark a node, click on the banner icon in the node footer. Any changes to a bookmarked node are reflected in the “bookmarked updates” tab in the sidebar that is to the left of the screen.
         </p>
         <img src="/static/tutorial/BookmarkingandMarkingNodesasStudied3.png" width="100%" />
         <p>A node will only appear in the bookmarked updates tab when it is marked as not studied. To easily navigate to a node in your bookmarked updates tab, click on the node title. Once you have reviewed the changes that have been made to the node you can mark the node as studied again it will disappear from the bookmarked updates tab (until it is edited again). If you do not want to have a node bookmarked anymore, you can simply click on the banner icon again.</p>

         <p>There are many icons and buttons along the node footer. First, on the far left you will see the top contributor or proposer of the node. Next to the profile picture, is an icon that shows the node type. Next to that, you will see the adjust node height button. You can select this when your nodes are overlapping and you cannot read your content. To the right of that, you will see the narration button. Select this to have the node content read out loud for you. After the narration button, there is the version history button with the calendar icon. When you select this, a sidebar will pop up showing you all the previous versions and edits proposed on a node. You can also see when the last edit was made next to the calendar icon.</p>
         <img src="/static/tutorial/NodeFooter1.png" width="100%" />
         <p>The pencil button will allow you to edit the node’s content directly or add a child node. The number next to the pencil indicates how many different proposed edits have been made to this node. Next you will see the tags and citations button. If you click this, you will be able to see the references and the different tags associated with a node.</p>
         <img src="/static/tutorial/NodeFooter2.png" width="100%" />
         <p>To the right of that you will see the downvote button. If you find that a node is not organized properly, inaccurate, or unhelpful, you can vote to delete it. Alternatively, the upvote button will allow you to vote to prevent further changes. You should use this for nodes that you find helpful. Note that up/downvoting a node directly impacts all the accepted proposals in the edit history of the node, proportionally based on their total upvotes minus downvotes. This consequently impacts the reputation points of the users who contributed those proposals. This is because in the history of evolution of a node, each accepted proposal has contributed to the extent that it has received upvotes minus downvotes and users' expressions of helpfulness/unhelpfulness of each nodes should impact all the proposals that have contributed to the evolution of the node.</p>
         <p>The next button, a banner icon, allows you to bookmark a node for later use. Next, you can use the envelope button to mark a node as studied. This is a great way to track your progress as you navigate through the map. Finally, you can click the right-most button to view the parents and children of a node.</p>

    stem:(
      <div>
         <p>Learning the difference between concept nodes and relation nodes on 1Cademy is one of the biggest challenges while proposing content on the knowledge graph. So, here are a few methods for figuring out whether a new node you are proposing should be a concept or a relation node. The first step is to think through what layout your node will have. Many relation nodes will be in the form of bulleted lists while concept nodes will most be be in paragraph form. However, this is not always the case as every once in a while you will have a bulleted list that is actually a concept node or a relation node that is in paragraph form. So even though knowing the the layout of your node can help in a terms of a realizing whether it is a concept node or a relation node, there are still more steps and critical thing necessary to truly nail down what type of node your node should be.</p>
         <p>The second step is to think through what the purpose of your node will be. If the node exists to introduce a new piece of information onto the map, it is a concept node. While all child nodes are related to their parent node, concept nodes define or describe a piece of information that can stand on its own. For example, even though the node “homelessness and runaways” is informed by the node “library as a place” by a virtue of being its child, it still shows a singular piece of information that can exist on its own and thus is a concept node.</p>
         <img src="/static/tutorial/RelationNodesvsConceptNodes1.png" width="100%" />
         <p>However, a relation node will reflect either how two or more nodes are connected to one another. Or, if it is a bulleted list, all of the bullets will relate to one another as a function of what the what the node is attempting to communicate. So if either of those cases are a true, then that is a a good sign that your node will be a relation node.</p>
         <img src="/static/tutorial/RelationNodesvsConceptNodes2.png" width="100%" />
         <p>However, there are cases where a node with the layout and purpose of a concept node are still a relation node so more evaluation and critical thinking about the node may still be necessary.</p>
         <p>The final step and perhaps the most difficult, is to understand the transformative nature of the node you are proposing. What this means is if adding the node changes the meaning or conceptualization of the nodes that come before it. For example adding a concept node after a parent node does not change anything about the meaning of the parent node or how we conceptualize it. However, a relation node is transformative and will change our conceptualization of its parent nodes. For an example, we examine the node “Contested Definitions of Non-Formal and Informal Education” (shown in video). At first glance, it may seem like a concept node. It has the layout most often ascribed to concept nodes and it shows a singular idea that arguably can stand on its own. However, what makes it a relation node is its transformative nature. Through this node, the conceptualization of its parents, that being “non-formal education” and “informal education,” is changed and the node itself shows a relationship between the definitions of non-formal and informal education. So, in fact, the “Contested Definitions of Non-Formal and Informal Education” node is a relation node. This is definitely the most difficult way to comprehend the difference between concept and and relation nodes and is the one that requires the most critical thinking, but it is the most useful especially when you are proposing a node that arguably could either be a concept or a relation node.</p>

         <p>As a single user, the first thing you need to do is make sure that you set your community tag. As you can see, mine is psychology and to change it I need to click on my profile picture and select the tag button. Here I've decided that I no longer want to be a part of the psychology community and that I'm going to switch to sociology. Once I click the button, you'll see that I'm prompted in red to click the node I would like to link to and I would like to link to sociology. Once it loads, you'll see an update on my profile and when I exit out of my profile you will also see it update on my sidebar. </p>
         <p>Next thing I have to do is add a reference node, so first I have to identify where all the sociology references are, in this case, they are linked to the relation node sociology references. I select the propose version of this node and then pick the reference child node option and when I do I'll get a blank node that allows me to copy in the citation and the title</p>
         <img src="/static/tutorial/GettingStartedAsaUser1.png" width="100%" />
         <p>I've already added my reference node so I'm going to go ahead and cancel that. Now that I've added my citation, I'm going to look at the information I want to summarize. So, there are two different kinds of social structures, one is horizontal and one is vertical and I would like to add the horizontal social structure term to the map.</p>
        <p>First, I need to find the prerequisite link, the immediate prerequisite link, so starting out in sociology, I'm going to start opening children until I distill the information far enough where I find the immediate prerequisite. I see that sociological structures are already added as a child so I'm going to go ahead and open that and see what it has to offer. I see that sociological structures are the different structures that societies are organized in and they can either be classified as horizontal or vertical. This is exactly where I want to add my content, I'll look at the children that already exist just to make sure that the information I want to add is not already on the map. So, I'll click to view the parent and child nodes and I see that the horizontal social structure has not been added as a child yet. So, I'll propose an edit to add a concept node, because horizontal social structures is a concept, and I'll see a blank node pop up.</p>    
        <img src="/static/tutorial/GettingStartedAsaUser2.png" width="100%" />
        <img src="/static/tutorial/GettingStartedAsaUser3.png" width="100%" />
        <p>You want to title your node as specifically, clearly, and concisely as possible. I'm going to just title the child node by what i'm defining, which is the horizontal social structure and then I need to define it in my own words. All content on 1Cademy should be paraphrased in your own words to help your learning and make sure that we're not actually plagiarizing. So the horizontal structure lets me refer to my source again, which is the social relationships and the social and physical characteristics of communities to which individuals belong. In my own words, I'm going to talk about how horizontal social structures refer to the relationships and communities that are connected to individuals. </p>
        <p>This is the first draft of my node, later we'll talk about the peer review process and I'm counting on the other people in my community to come in and help me improve this node as best we can, but for now what i'm going to do is go ahead and cite my reference. All you have to do is click cite an existing reference and then select the reference node that you want to cite, also this is chapter 1.2 Understanding Society, so i'm going to specify the chapter, page number or the url that you want to use. I'm going to propose the node and I'll see that it now exists.</p>

         <p>To help you better understand the structure of information on 1Cademy, we are going to go over prerequisite linking. First, we're going to break down the term and then we will define it within the context of 1Cademy. Breaking down the term “prerequisite linking,” we see that “prerequisite” is the knowledge or information required before one can proceed to learning any new knowledge or information. So for example, you need to learn <strong>how to count</strong> (prerequisite information) before you can learn <strong>how to add</strong>  (new information). Then, “linking” is defined as connecting one thing to something else - like moving from counting to adding.</p>
         <img src="/static/tutorial/PrerequisiteLinkingon1Cademy1.png" width="100%" />
         <p>When we put the terms together, we see that prerequisite linking is when new units of information are connected to foundational units of information. These foundational units need to be learned before one can move onto the new units. </p>
         <img src="/static/tutorial/PrerequisiteLinkingon1Cademy2.png" width="100%" />
         <p>Prerequisite linking on 1Cademy is defined as: the nodes are organized in a hierarchy where what is needed to learn a concept is connected as a parent node. Looking at an example on the 1Cademy map, you can see that you need to know what concepts are before learning what a conceptual model is, and you need to know what a conceptual model is before you can understand concept mapping. You will see that the parent nodes are linked on the left, and the green arrow denotes the child node linked on the right (example is explained in the video).</p>

         <p>The first step in adding a new node to 1Cademy is finding the immediate prerequisite or the parent node. All parent nodes should contain the direct or immediate prerequisite information that a user needs to understand or learn through a follow-up child node. Users must first find or add the parent node that contains the immediate prerequisite information to the child node that they want to add. </p>
         <p>You can check to see if the immediate prerequisite already exists on the map or you can add or link the prerequisites that are necessary for the information that you want to add. First, do a search for the immediate prerequisite, using the search feature. You can watch the video by using the search feature on 1Cademy to help you out. If you use a search feature you can perform a keyword search to look for terms that might be in an immediate prerequisite node.</p>
         <p>A user can also click through the links in the area that they want to add their node to and as they click through the links they might find that the immediate prerequisite already exists. If your immediate prerequisite does not already exist in your area of the map, or if it does exist somewhere else, what you're going to have to do is link it to your area of the map.</p>
         <p>Alternatively, you could add a node to your area of the map and link your child node there. Sometimes, you will have to go through all the ancestor or all the prerequisites available within the topic. These ancestors may provide prerequisite information but they may not provide the direct or immediate prerequisite information, therefore, you should go through these nodes until you find the gap in knowledge and add your own prerequisites.</p>
         <p>So, the direct information needed for your new child node will now exist on the map. Those are the two main ways you can either look to see if an immediate prerequisite already exists, add or link your own prerequisites to make sure that your new child node has the direct prerequisite information it needs so that users can learn through the links on 1Cademy without any gaps in knowledge.</p>

         <p>I click on open access to go to that node and here I can see what relationships it has by viewing the parent and child nodes. I can also navigate to this prerequisite node by browsing through the map.</p>
         <img src="/static/tutorial/DemonstrationofFindingtheImmediatePrerequisite2.png" width="100%" />
         <p>Let's start with the node, types of librarianship and move over to the academic librarianship node, as I think this is a common topic in that field, then we move to topics in Academic Librarianship, which takes us to open access. I need to know what open access is before I can understand the concept of open access publishing, so I want to add open access publishing as a child node to open access; however, after considering what open access entails I realize there are many other topics in open access. So, it would be better to add a child relation node to open access for topics and open access first. Alternatively, we could link any appropriate prerequisite that already exists on the map by editing that node to add open access as a parent once the knowledge gap is filled with the appropriate prerequisite nodes. Then, I can link my open access publishing node to the topics in the open access node as a child concept node.</p>

         <p>It is recommended that you consider editing a node before downvoting it, especially if you think it could be improved. First, go to the node that you want to propose an edit for and select the pencil icon from the bottom menu. The left sidebar will open, showing you the options available. At the bottom of the list, you will see the edit or improve this node option, and beneath this list, you will see any currently pending proposals where you're welcome to vote on proposals.</p>
         <img src="/static/tutorial/ProposinganEditon1Cademy1.png" width="100%" />
         <p>Select the “edit or improve this node option”, and you will be returned to your selected node, which is now available for editing. Here, you can change the title. This will open the search option on the left so you can check for existing nodes with that title. You can also alter the content within the node and provide a reason for the proposed edit so that others can review your recommendation and vote on your proposed edit.</p>
         <p>If you look beneath the explanation field, at the bottom of the node, you will see the “references and tags” option is open, revealing that you can delete current links to a reference, enter a page number for the existing reference, enter a timestamp for voice or video material, and you can cite an existing reference. When you select “cite an existing reference”, you will see a message appear that instructs you to click the node you'd like to link to then navigate over to the desired reference node and you click it, which returns you to your edit proposal node now showing the added citation.</p>
         <img src="/static/tutorial/ProposinganEditon1Cademy2.png" width="100%" />
         <p>If you look to the node’s bottom right, you see the current tags, which you can also remove or add an existing tag. In adding an existing tag, this option will instruct you to click the node you'd like to link to, navigate to the desired node, and select. The new tag will appear in the edit proposal node. When you select the image icon, it will open your local file explorer so that you can select your proposed image. You can also select the parent and child nodes to view on the left; you have the option of linking to an existing parent. Once selected, you are prompted to click the node you want to add as a parent. On the right, you have the option to remove existing child nodes or link to an existing child node which will also ask you to click the node to be added as a child node.</p>
         <img src="/static/tutorial/ProposinganEditon1Cademy3.png" width="100%" />
         <p>If you want to remove a parent node from your current edit proposal node, select a new parent node here before proposing a separate edit to remove this child node from the old parent node. Once you are satisfied with your proposed edits, you can click the propose button or cancel if you have changed your mind, and this is how you propose an edit in 1Cademy.</p>

          This video gives an overview of what happens after a node edit is proposed, how the pending proposals list
          works, and what happens when one up/down-votes nodes and proposals.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Note:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Any proposed change to a node gets implemented as soon as it receives net-votes (number of upvotes minus
              downvotes) greater than or equal to half the net-votes that the corresponding node has received.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the number of down-votes on a node gets greater than its number of up-votes, the node will be deleted
              from the whole knowledge graph and no one will be able to retrieve it.

      <div>
         <p>Once you make a proposal it will either be immediately accepted or sent to the pending proposals list. The route it takes depends on how many upvotes and downvotes there are for the edited node. The total number of downvotes is subtracted from the total number of upvotes. If this number is less than three, any proposals will automatically be accepted and if this number is more than three, such as with the Library Science node, which has eight upvotes and zeroes downvotes, the proposal will go to the pending proposals list.</p>
         <p>The pending proposal list is based on your community tag and can be found on the sidebar. In evaluating a pending proposal, click on the proposal in the pending list, the node that the proposal is for will pop up. Then, click propose/evaluate versions of this node, located at the bottom of the node, and click on the pending proposal you want to evaluate.</p>
         <p>Evaluate whether you think the proposal is helpful or unhelpful by looking at the parent or ancestor nodes to understand the node you are editing. The proposal will be accepted when it receives a sum of upvotes minus downvotes equal to over half the sum of upvotes minus downvotes to the node it is changing. So, for the Focuses of Library Science node that has thirteen upvotes, any proposal will need to get seven upvotes to go through. </p>
         <p>Pending proposals cannot be downvoted off of the pending proposals list. To evaluate them, you should open the list of pending proposals on a specific node by clicking the pencil button on the node. Pending proposals will continue to get up or down votes until they either qualify as an accepted edit or the original creator deletes the proposal.</p>

      <div>
         <p>Research papers are structured differently than a textbook. We want to ensure we know how to summarize research papers and apply that information when proposing nodes on 1Cademy. The general process for proposing new information to the platform is to find the appropriate area of the map. Then, propose a reference node for your source. Next, find the immediate prerequisite for the new content you'd like to add and propose your nodes.</p>
         <p>Some considerations for research papers; make sure to summarize the paper's findings as discrete concepts and relations. You don't want to have multiple concepts all in the same node. You also don't need to propose a node for every section of the research paper. You don't need to have a methods node or an analysis node but include nodes based on the concepts rather than the structure of the paper. That means you don't need to summarize the entire paper when you're adding new content from it on the platform. Focus mostly on the findings, their discussion, and what they contributed to the body of knowledge for the field they’re studying.</p>
         <p>For example, take a paper about teaching specifically about Dialogic Pedagogy. Pedagogy is an approach to teaching. Dialogic means discussion based. So, for this example, I would work in the education area on the 1Cademy platform. Once you have found the specific topics your paper focuses on, use the search tool, or navigate through the nodes on the platform to find where your content will need to be added.</p>       
         <img src="/static/tutorial/SummarizingaPaperon1Cademy1.png" width="100%" />
          <p>The first thing you will add is a reference node. That way you can use this node when you're citing later nodes. Each broad topic on 1Cademy should have a reference parent node, and this is where you'll add the reference node for your paper. It is important to make sure you use APA format when you are adding this new reference node. Once you have done that, your next step is to find the specific nodes that will be the immediate prerequisite for the content you want to add. Make sure that you're not duplicating content that already exists on the map. If the immediate prerequisite that you need doesn't exist, then you can always propose it.</p>
          <img src="/static/tutorial/SummarizingaPaperon1Cademy2.png" width="100%" />     
         <p> Your next step is to propose the nodes. Make sure that you are paraphrasing or summarizing information. We don't use direct quotes on 1Cademy. You also should be citing the page numbers for the paper when adding content for each node. Keep in mind what concepts the research paper is contributing to the larger body of knowledge for the field. For example, in the earlier mentioned pedagogy paper, what new concepts is the paper contributing to the field of education?</p>
         <img src="/static/tutorial/SummarizingaPaperon1Cademy3.png" width="100%" /> 
         <p>Still using the pedagogy paper as an example, on 1Cademy, there are no nodes about the pedagogy paper’s methods, specifically there are no nodes about the literature review. All of the information has been summarized conceptually. However, there is an immediate prerequisite node called Discussion in Education. The prerequisite already existed, so I did not need to create a prerequisite for myself. The paper went over several different features of discussion in education, discussing some theories of dialogic teaching. I then added some nodes after these child relation nodes about dialogism and sociocultural theory of learning. I found that the third theory it discusses, social constructivism, already exists and linked it to my relation node Theories of Dialogistic Teaching as a child node. I have also added nodes on the features of dialogic teaching and obstacles to dialogic teaching that the paper discusses, but I do not have any specific nodes based on the structure of the paper, only concepts proposed or discussed in the paper.</p>
