      <p>
        You are invited to participate in this research study to investigate the
        effect of different knowledge representation formats on reading
        comprehension and learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you agree to be part of the research study, you will be asked to
        attend a recorded one-on-one online study session where the Researcher
        asks you to share your screen to show them how you answer different
        types of questions on our experiment webpage. You will go through two
        passages and answer some multiple-choice questions and some free-recall
        questions about the passages in different types of knowledge
        representation formats. The study session will last approximately an
        hour and 30 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        After completing the first study session, you will need to attend a
        second study session for about 30 minutes, in three days from the first
        one. In the second study session we will retest your learning on the
        topics.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are no risks, however, you will be asked to share your screen to
        present how you read the passages and answer questions.
      </p>
      <p>There is no compensation for participation in this research.</p>
      <p>
        Participating in this study is completely voluntary. Even if you decide
        to participate now, you may change your mind and stop at any time. You
        may choose not to answer any question or request to pause or stop your
        participation for any reason.
      </p>
      <p>We will not collect any sensitive or identifiable information.</p>
      <p>
        Information collected in this project may be shared with other
        researchers, but we will not share any information that could identify
        you.
