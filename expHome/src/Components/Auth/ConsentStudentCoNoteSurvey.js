      <h2>GENERAL Information</h2>
      <h3>2. PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>2.1 Study purpose:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We are conducting a study to learn more about the helpful/unhelpful study strategies that students use in order
        to inform school administrators, instructors, and students about the helpful study techniques. To get
        information, we would appreciate your input on your personal experience with using study strategies in Winter
        2022. We are also studying factors such as gender and achievement that might influence which strategies are
        used.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What will I do?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        You will fill out a survey that will ask you various questions about the study strategies you used throughout
        the past semester and your thoughts on those and other strategies. We expect the survey to take on average 45
        minutes to complete. You do not have to answer it if youâ€™d rather not. You can skip any questions that you do
        not want to answer and you do not need to explain the reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you agree to be part of the research study, you will be asked to attend a recorded one-on-one online
        interview session where the interviewer asks the interviewee to share their screen to show them how they answer
        different types of questions on our experiment webpage and explain their answers to each question.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Is Participation Required?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        No, this study is completely voluntary. However, only those who complete the survey will be entered into the
        raffle.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Compensation</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The research team will select ten participants for their thoughtful responses on the survey and will send each a
        $100 Amazon Gift Card.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are no risks, however, you will be asked to share your screen to present how you read the passages and
        answer questions, and talk throughout the recorded interview.
      </p>
      <p>There is no compensation for participation in this research.</p>
      <p>
        Participating in this study is completely voluntary. Even if you decide to participate now, you may change your
        mind and stop at any time. You may choose not to answer any or request to pause or stop the interview for any
        reason.
      </p>
      <p>We will not collect any sensitive or identifiable information.</p>
      <p>
        Information collected in this project may be shared with other researchers, but we will not share any
        information that could identify you.
