          <strong>1.1 Key Study Information</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          You may be eligible to take part in a research study. This form contains important information that will help
          you decide whether to join the study. Take the time to carefully review this information. You should talk to
          the researchers about the study and ask them any questions you have. You may also wish to talk to others such
          as your family, friends, or other doctors about joining this study. If you decide to join the study, you will
          be asked to sign this form before you can start study-related activities. Before you do, be sure you
          understand what the research study is about. There can be risks associated with joining any research study.
          The type of risk may impact whether you decide to join the study. For this study, some of these risks may
          include breach of confidentiality. More detailed information will be provided later in this document. This
          study may not offer you any immediate benefits but it could help others develop better study strategies. More

        <h3>2. PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>2.1 Study purpose:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          We are conducting a study to learn more about the helpful/unhelpful study strategies that students use in
          order to inform school administrators, instructors, and students about the helpful study techniques. To get
          information, we would appreciate your input on your personal experience with using study strategies in Winter
          2022. We are also studying factors such as gender and achievement that might influence which strategies are
          used.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What will I do?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          You will fill out a survey that will ask you various questions about the study strategies you used throughout
          the past semester and your thoughts on those and other strategies. We expect the survey to take on average 45
          minutes to complete. You do not have to answer it if you’d rather not. You can skip any questions that you do
          not want to answer and you do not need to explain the reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you agree to be part of the research study, you will be asked to attend a recorded one-on-one online
          interview session where the interviewer asks the interviewee to share their screen to show them how they
          answer different types of questions on our experiment webpage and explain their answers to each question.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Is Participation Required?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          No, this study is completely voluntary. However, only those who complete the survey will be entered into the
          raffle.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Compensation</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The research team will select ten participants for their thoughtful responses on the survey and will send each
          a $100 Amazon Gift Card.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Possible Risks</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          A possible risk is breach of confidentiality, but we will protect your data by storing it on University of
          Michigan protected servers and encrypted laptops and de-identifying the data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your data will be de-identified once the researchers merge the datasets and your personal information (email)
          will be replaced with an ID.
        </p>
        <p> A cross-walk will be created with the email and the ID, which will be destroyed at the end of the study.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Possible Benefits</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          There will be no direct benefits for completing this survey. The findings may help all students, instructors,
          and school administrators learn helpful study strategies for academic success. Also, the results of this study
          will inform students, instructors, school administrators, and researchers about how gender and prior academic
          achievement can play a role in students' perception and utilization of effective learning strategies. This
          will help school administrators and instructors to inform students in order to help decrease the performance
          gap between male vs. female and low vs. high-achieving students.
