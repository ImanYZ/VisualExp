Because television networks only have a limited time slot in which they show the news, they must cram as much information as possible into this short period of time.

Additionally, the news broadcasted on television jumps from story to story with no segue, giving viewers no time to think more about the story they just heard.

As for passage 2, the flow chart format made it easy to read the story by parts. The links between different parts were clearly explained and appreciated. Yet, it was still hard to go back and locate information because the paragraphs came in chunks. Since I have spent a lot of time trying to locate the exact sentences in the question, I still remember a lot about the story.","I think passage 1 is very helpful for review. The links between individual concepts are very clear and take me little time to learn. If only I could be more engaged with the passage, I may be able to memorize the contents. 

I think passage 2 is a bit tricky. It helps me understand the flow of the story but I think literary academic learning is more than that. For instance, the tone and effect of specific phrases cannot be reflected by the flow chart. For literary texts, it may be more helpful to provide the original text, side annotations, and a separate plot chart. Also, the flow chart breaks the original format of a story, which may change the way students understand the passage. "

She was probably born in Cuba. In her early childhood, she and her sister could not go to school because the regime did not allow girls to have an education, and her brother could not go to school because their family could not afford it. Later, due to the change of the regime, all the kids were able to go to school. 

In one of the school's classes, Isabella went to a local theatre to see a ballet show, and this experience completely changed her life. She hadn't heard about theatre prior to the time and was awed by the grandeur of the theatre. The ballet show, especially its expression of country life, strongly moved Isabella.

As for passage 2, the flow chart format made it easy to read the story by parts. The links between different parts were clearly explained and appreciated. Yet, it was still hard to go back and locate information because the paragraphs came in chunks. Since I have spent a lot of time trying to locate the exact sentences in the question, I still remember a lot about the story.","I think passage 1 is very helpful for review. The links between individual concepts are very clear and take me little time to learn. If only I could be more engaged with the passage, I may be able to memorize the contents. 

I think passage 2 is a bit tricky. It helps me understand the flow of the story but I think literary academic learning is more than that. For instance, the tone and effect of specific phrases cannot be reflected by the flow chart. For literary texts, it may be more helpful to provide the original text, side annotations, and a separate plot chart. Also, the flow chart breaks the original format of a story, which may change the way students understand the passage. "

Critics dont agree with the money spent on zoos and some don't agree with putting animals in zoos in the first place. ,,2022/01/14 23:53:49,5,0.625,799,52.201249999999995,Both,K2,2022/01/15 00:18:45,2022/01/15 00:13:21,The first passage had more information and I think the short phrase summary with a link was a good way to separate the information into link while also connecting them together.

For example, I was able to easily separate the roles each parent played in the protagonist's life because the information was kept separate. Passage 2, on the other hand, was much easier to navigate. Thanks to the headers in each bubble, I was able to find the passage that contained the information I needed very easily. I like to create mind-maps like this when I am studying for a test.

When all the details were split up it was much easier to find the information because I was able to use the signposts to efficiently go to the section I needed to look at. However, having so many hyperlinks made the information hard to keep track of. I found myself wasting more time looking for specific information. When answering the question for passage 2, I was able to scan the whole map, locate details for all the questions, and come back to each section when it was applicable. This meant that I skipped over more information in paragraph 2, and did not grasp the information as thoroughly.","Passage 1 was very interesting because it helped me compartmentalize information very effectively. The mind-map itself felt like a visual representation of the inner workings of my brain. I did not have to spend any time mapping all the information myself. For example, I was able to easily separate the roles each parent played in the protagonist's life because the information was kept separate. Passage 2, on the other hand, was much easier to navigate. Thanks to the headers in each bubble, I was able to find the passage that contained the information I needed very easily. I like to create mind-maps like this when I am studying for a test. However, there were some times when I mixed up small details in the paragraph such as similar words or lists. If I had not gone back to check my work I would have missed a careless mistake. In short, I prefer passage 1 but find passage 2 to be a very good, more efficient, alternative."

This may be because I am relatively unfamiliar with the concepts of ""Managerial Decision Making"" besides some statistics. This may also be because I did not have to read all the passages to be able to answer the questions. When I see the questions I will probably remember more. There were some questions in the paragraph that confused me due to the wording and I had to go back and check. I remember there being two scientists that tested auto- and homo-.

You may find the correct path immediately, or you will have to run into several dead ends first. Although the dead ends do not directly get you the answer, it narrows your search for alternative roughts. I had to take the wrong path several times before I was able to find the answer and in turn I was able to learn much more information. I am also someone who highly benefits from intricate mind-maps because my thoughts tend to get confused in my head. I like having everything separated for me.","As I explained in the previous question, I found passage 1 to be much more efficient. Although there were far more buttons I had to push and navigate in order to get the answer, I still found the passage much easier to understand. Infact, having to work harder and remember where all the information was helped me remember the information more. When I was looking for the answer to one question, I would collect details along the way. When I saw another question that refers to the information I had previously seen, I needed to use active recall to find it again. Again, this also can be attributed to the way that I personally work best. I can see why paragraph 1 can be very disorienting or confusing for some people.

Wildlife corridors are a method of habitat conservation that serve to bridge little patches of still-existing habitats, which encourages habitat revitalization and a potential boost in animal population.

There were several correlations of the new panda exhibit to Dr. Wan's previous research.

Dr. Wan spent a lot of time with a mother panda, and was excited when the panda left him the responsibility of caring for her cub.

Pandas are very symbolically significant in China. The black and white fur symbolizes yin and yang, and pandas were symbols of peace and diplomacy several times in Chinese history.

The new zoo exhibit was relevant to Dr. Wan's research. 

Dr. Wan once connected with a mother panda so well that the panda allowed him to take care of her cub unattended.

Another point that the passage itself relates are the jumping mechanisms that accompany the action of the jaws-snapping.

- explain two methods: jumping wherein they stick mandibles/ head towards ground and shoot up to surprise the attacker and allows ant to get into position to attack AND attack wherein the ant throws the invader in the opposite direction which makes the ant also go in another direction

I think passage 1 could be easier to read if I had more experience using this representation format. ,"Both passages have their merit, I think after seeing my scores I was not entirely surprised by the results in that I do have better free recall in regards to fictional stories but do better on nonfiction when there are prompted questions given. I see that both passages have had their advantages in terms of my memories of the readings. Since the prima ballerina had an emphasis on the chronological order of events made free recall easier, also because the format forced me to have to comprehend the nature of events. For the jaws that jump however it became easier to search and find specific words which indicated an answer. In this, there was less need to remember the information because it was more of find the fact and answer the question. I think both passages have benefits for learning in that they both encourage reflection on the content and the need to understand the representation formats. "

- The ""Now, this"" model of television, which primes viewers to consume another short, compressed piece of news, which is unrelated to the topic preceding it. As a result of this model, viewers become desensitized to the severity of the tragedies that they consume. Generally, these segments are extremely short. 
- The role of appearance is also extremely important in how viewers perceive the credibility of their news, wherein more attractive faces are more likely to generate positive reactions. This was well-exhibited by the case of one female newscaster (Christine) who was fired after being hired at a news station, as viewers responded poorly to her appearance. In response, she sued the station. 
- The phenomenon of ""talking hairdos"" is also common, which refers to the prioritization of the appearance of newscasters over their words/the news that they are sharing.

In order to protect themselves from their own jaw, the jaws are able to slow down right before closure so the two halves of the jaw don't clash into each other. These jaws also allowed them to have 2 different defensive strategies. One of the strategies allowed the ants to, lining themselves up perpendicular to the ground, launch off of the ground and jump to higher ground in order to escape or attack their enemy at a different location.

","I think in the long run, both passages are helpful for academic learning because by this time, I mainly remember the few main parts of the passage but rarely minor details of either passage. As learning the main ideas and the details around the main points is more important for academic learning, both representation formats are helpful as I was able to retain that goal from both passages. I think it mainly depends on the learning types of individuals. For example, the format for passage 2 may be better for visual learners than passage 1. "

Dr. Wang talks about how important the status of pandas are in China as they represent yin and yang and are conservationist ambassadors. Critics criticize the budget that is spent on these new panda exhibits since it is human nature that is to blame and change. However, Dr. Wang recognizes that the revenue created from these exhibits are beneficial in the long run because it can provide money for further research and wildlife conservation. The new exhibit aims to increase the panda habitat and give visitors a chance to experience the habitat.

Therefore, I don't really have a good idea about what that whole page was about in general.

This article primarily focused on the areas of study of the conservationist as well as how his studies influenced the panda exhibit at the national zoo. He disagreed with the notion on why critics believed panda conservation to be skewed and misconstrued because he believed that efforts to conserve pandas would trigger the conservation of other species of wildlife, as he considered pandas to be the face, or icon, of wildlife conservation. Some of his studies led to knew introductions to the zoo, including a new enclosure for the pandas that more accurately mimicked their natural habitat, and included a cooling rock, a panda groto, and a discussion area for visitors to further learn more about conservation efforts. The author of this article comparede panda conservation efforts to that of a river and its tendency to flow.

Further, while passage 2 was not in its simplest form, it flowed and was easier to read through fluidly. ","Like I said, I believe that passage 2 was easier to read due to the fluidity of the words and passage 1 was easier to interpret, forging better academic learning. I believe this to be true because the information was divided into its most simplest form, where the reader actively had to put in work to interpret the connection between each word/idea/component of the story. As a result of having to put in this work to connect simple components of a sentence, the reader thus had to insert more effort into processing a single entity, which overall is more conducive to better memory of things and increased academic learning.

The National Zoo had renovated the panda enclosures to more accurately mimic the natural panda habitat. Some other inclusions to the zoo were the cooling rocks, panda grottos, and discussion stations where visitors would be able to learn more about the influence and importance of panda conservation. Critics believed that panda conservation is skewed and minimizes other conservation efforts, but Dr. Wang disagrees as he believes pandas are a key face of conservation efforts for other species and that efforts to preserve and nourish panda species will trickle down into efforts to preserve other species.

I believe that the formatting for passage 2 was more beneficial to my own academic learning because of the chunks of text that it included. The first passage was more divided up and spread out, so retaining quantity was much less likely than it is for the formatting of passage 2. Since the questions were shown with the text, I found myself not reading through every single small box in the story as I simply observed the answers to the questions and moved on. As for the formatting of passage 2, I had to read through every bit of information in order to learn more and find more answers to the questions.

If they can keep viewers, they can keep the job basically. This lead one woman to suing  the television network she worked for, believing they fired her for not fitting their standards for a female host. The author argues that this presentation of television news devalues the actual news, and takes away seriousness from serious matters. The author brings up the phrase ""Now.. this"" which is a common T.V. phrase used to quickly transition from one topic to the next. This quick transition of topics is done because airtime is a valuable commodity for the television networks.

This quick changing from topic to topic, devalues each topic in specific, and makes it harder for the viewer to take the news seriously. What the viewer does take seriously, argues the author, is the perceived attractiveness and credibility of the reporter. Thus, T.V. networks try to chooses the most attractive well-spoken people to present the news, not those who could actually present the news in the most accurate and meaningful way.

When you want a person to get straight to the point and the information, I think Passage 1's format is better. When you really want your audience to read the passage thoroughly to take in all the information, I think Passage 2 is best. "

- Firstly, the jaws are the fastest in the world meaning attacking prey is easy for these ants. However, the ants never harm themselves as the speed decelerates quickly. The jaw is able to move so quickly due to a store up of energy in the ants muscles.

- Secondly, the sheer speed of the jaws gives the ants jumping skills. They can either jump from defense or attack. When an attacking ant enters the nest, the home ant attacks and flings the attacking ant in the opposite direction and sends itself in the other. The ant often lands in a position to be able to launch a new attack.

One of the key points that were indicated by the author was through a critique that mentioned how text messages did not express any feelings or tone which removed that extra sense of communicating with someone. Despite this criticism, the author does point out that text messaging has a history feature where anyone that has not deleted their messages can go back anytime to look back at past conversations, making these occurrences endless in a way. Having text messages not only is great for keeping a history of what you have talked about, but it is also quick and easy compared to conversations made in person.

I did not get lost while trying to find where I needed to read next and that helped with me understanding what the passage was talking about. 

Passage 2 on the other hand seemed to branch out way too much with a couple of words on each box. Having to read every box and line just to get to the point of something takes too many visual disturbances as I have having to move my eye to locate the next box while figuring out if I was reading on the right path.  It took me multiple times to read each section of passage two when it was unnecessary as the number of boxes can be greatly reduced to explain the same exact information with a few sentences rather than a couple of words and having to look at more boxes to get more information. ","While it did seem like I prefer passage 1 as it was easier to read, I can see passage 2 as an effective way to study and learn since it provides information quickly to some extent by reducing the number of words in each box. I can see passage 1's structure as more of a lesson/study session where a student can go more in detail learning about something while for passage 2, that can be for someone that needs a quick recap of what they learned on a certain topic. I think that if you add a sentence of two in passage 2's structure rather than a couple words in each box can make it a better way to access quick information as it can reduce the visual clutter and needing multiple boxes to give the point across.

They lack what can be seen in-person communication as we look at a person's face to determine their mood and reactions to whatever they are listening to. Despite this negative, the author does point out the positives of text messaging as a medium of communication as it can be used as a way to go back to past messages like a memoir of events that occurred.

The growth of television into a medium primarily meant for entertainment influences all areas, including news. People need to be drawn into the news visually in order to take in what they are being told. As well, the person in charge of presenting the news has a very significant hold on how viewers feel.

There is a significant impact in how news is presented on television because the primary focus of television is to serve as entertainment, not necessarily serious news communication. Some topics that were brought up specifically include the ""and now... this"" form of transition which allows the newscaster to completely switch topics. This often involves moving on from some news that is dramatic and/or negative in some way and diverting the attention onto something new, either an unrelated, positive subject or perhaps a commercial break. Aesthetics were also discussed regarding news presenters. The passage discussed that viewers are more likely to not only want to watch but also believe what a newscaster is saying if they are visually appealing.

The force of these jaws comes from pent-up energy stores in their muscles, which is released when the jaws snap shut, though they decelerate before meeting to prevent injury to the ant. The jumping function, also propelled by the ants' jaw, may, according to some scientists who specialize in the study of this species, have evolved through accidental behavior such as banging the head to the ground.

Finally, the intruder-expelling function of jaws is triggered when the ants touch the inside of their jaws to their targets, causing the jaw-snapping reflex to come into play.

Barn Owls have individual neurons that when one is stimulated by an auditory noise, sends a signal to the Barn Owl indicating where exactly in space the sound came from. This is extremely helpful as Barn Owls hunt at night rather than the daytime. An example of how effective this hearing is for Barn Owls, when they are bearing down on a prey, say a mouse for example, they are able to realign their talons with a mouse that is running or moving side to side.

The barn owl has very accurate locating ability both in horizontal and vertical. It is due to two reasons: 1) its ability to sense minor difference in change in sound 2) its facial structure. Its acuity mainly comes from one neuron in its brain. Researchers also had experiment of bar owl preying on a small mouse in dark. Its ability to turn based on the angle of the mouse proves its ability of detecting minor changes. The trough also helps the barn owl. Comparing with humans, the barn owl's ability to catch preys are similar in horizontal but three times as accurate as humans in vertical.

The second passage is more of a science passage. There are more descriptions and less concepts or relations there. So the second one that have less ""mapping"" is also suitable for the knowledge it represents.",The first passage have more of an advanced-fundamental format. I think it is pretty useful and important in my academic learning since in this way I could first get insights into the big picture and then fill each concept with the details.

They require not only horizontal but also vertical accuracy because the barn owl catches preys in the air. The reason of this accuracy can be attributed to two points: the first being its ability to detect minor changes in sound and the second being its facial structure. For the first point, the barn owl can detect minor changes in sound directions, which is evidenced by an experiment. The barn owl can change its direction to align with the mouse in dark. Their particular facial structure also helps in this sound collecting process. The barn owl has a large trough.

The first one contains many ""nodes"" and relations between those nodes. It is better for me when I have more time and can memorize all the nodes and the relationship. But given a short time, I could only learn and recall a small part of the nodes. When reading further nodes, I might forget about the previous nodes. For the second passage, although the structure is not as specific/well-defined as the first one, I can grasp the main idea and the general structure of the passage, instead of being overwhelmed by the details/relations within the passage. Therefore, both serve as a good format of learning but just for different situations. The first one is better for long-time learning and the second one is better for short-time.","As for a long-time learning, the first passage provides a better mind map for me. As I mentioned in the last question, the first one provides a clear structure for every concepts involved in the topic; this is what I need for academic learning. Also, the kind of ""top-down"" (not sure I used the correct word) representation where I learn the larger concept and then dig into the details is very useful in academic area and researches. The second aims at a more general learning.

Firstly, it is able to detect some changes in the directions of sound. It is evidenced by the experiment in which the barn owl can align its mouth the mouse in dark environment. The trough also helps in the process. The hair is transparent in collecting sound. When the barn owl hear sound from a small place, a part of neuron in its brain is stimulated.

Wang believes that the focus on giant pandas has caused more people to be aware of necessary environmentalism efforts and also to learn about how complex the movement to conserve the environment is, requiring thought to economics in addition to biology. Some critics of Wang have argued that trying to help animals via zoos is useless because the main threat to these animals is habitat destruction. However, Wang believes that zoos provide necessary spaces for animals like pandas to grow and reproduce. The National Zoo in Washington, D.C., for example, has created its panda exhibit to reflect their natural environment.

On one occasion, a panda mother grew so accustomed to having him around that she even left him with her cub for a while. He found this experience to be quite joyful. Great pandas are also very important in Chinese politics and conservation, representing yin and yang with their color pattern. Dr. Wang argues that public sentiment favoring great pandas has caused more interest in conservation efforts worldwide, and zoos across the world have begun to help great pandas breed. In particular, the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., which was formed in 2006, raised a great panda Bao Bao which brought many to visit the zoo. Furthermore, the great panda exhibit has grown since then and underwent a renovation which expanded its size. The exhibit mimics pandas' natural environment and also now includes resources for visitors, such as places in which they can experience panda habitats and Decision Stations where they can learn about the ethics and economic aspects of conservation -- learning about conservation efforts requiring work from more than just biologists. Critics of zoos and Dr. Wang's work have argued that the greatest threat to great pandas' survival is habitat destruction and that zoos do not address this loss by merely breeding the pandas; however, Dr. Wang argues that some zoos can still offer improvements to conservation efforts through creating public awareness and helping those animals survive.",,2022/03/26 20:15:36,7,0.875,167,20.25565,K2,Both,2022/03/26 20:21:03,,"I found the flow of Passage 2 easier to follow and, in particular, skim, whereas it was very difficult for me to skim Passage 1. I had to treat Passage 1 more like I might treat a dense reading for a class, in which I had to re-read the same section multiple times because the first time through, I might not see the answer to a particular multiple choice question even if it was right in front of me. From that perspective, Passage 2 was much easier for me to navigate. I believe this is because it was sectioned more and felt as though I was reading simple sentences (almost like a picture book) rather than big chunks of information.","I am honestly a little confused because I had the impression that I understood Passage 2 better than Passage 1, and it is much easier for me to summarize what I read in Passage 2, but I felt much less comfortable with the multiple choice questions for Passage 2. I feel as though I understood Passage 2 again like a picture book, more like a story, in which I was able to understand the flow and structure of the passage better to reproduce a version of it through memory. However, in terms of remembering the specific details, I wonder if I actually retained more of Passage 1. I do feel as though this might have occurred because I did have to reread several aspects of Passage 1 and sift through the information. The higher amount of cognitive effort the passage required perhaps resulted in me learning the ""facts"" and ""answers"" better. For academic learning, I think sometimes both skills are useful in different ways. For impromptu speaking and speech-giving, Passage 2 would probably help me most, while for writing an essay or taking a memorization-based test, Passage 1 might be preferable for me."

Several of Dr. Wang's contributions have been implemented in zoos to help conserve and breed pandas. Critics of Dr. Wang argue that the greatest threat to panda extinction is the destruction of their environments. While this is true, the passage appeared to focus more on the benefits of zoos and how it is still important for them to help breed pandas. Particularly, Dr. Wang points out that pandas like Bao Bao (who was brought to the National Zoo of Washington, DC) have garnered much public attention which has in turn caused people to be more focused and concerned about conservation. Within China, great pandas are a symbol of diplomacy and very important as they represent yin and yang and have aided the conservation effort. In the U.S. as well, the National Zoo has garnered much attention due to Bao Bao and other pandas that arrived afterwards. The zoo recently underwent a renovation which expanded the size of the panda habitat and allowed options for visitors to experience panda habitats. Decision Stations were also created to allow visitors to learn about the controversies and complexity of conservation.

Passage 2 required less concentration for me to understand, and I felt as though I could find the answers to questions very quickly.","I am surprised to see that my written response score for Passage 1 actually increased over time, while my written response score for Passage 2 decreased. I felt much more confident retelling the information within Passage 2, but I think what I felt confident in was understanding the cause and effect relationships rather than remembering specific facts and dates. From the number of possible points, it appears that there was overall more content in Passage 1 than Passage 2 which is what I mentioned in my response during the previous test, so I'm having a hard time interpreting my scores, as proportionally my score for Passage 2 was technically higher out of the total content available than the proportion correct for Passage 1. It does look like I retained more content overall in Passage 1, though. Also, I scored surprisingly well on the pretest for Passage 1, which I think made it easier for me to remember/guess my test answers later on and repeat them in my written responses. For passage 2, my score did improve a lot from the initial pretest. I think I would maintain that if I had to give an impromptu presentation or speech on a topic, I would prefer Passage 2, but if I had to take a memorization test, I would prefer Passage 1."

She remembers vividly about the grand appearance of the location. When looking at the performance, she was entranced at how amazing it looked, and leaned forward in her seat. After that performance, she became very interested in ballerina performance s and would often go attend them. She also tried getting into ballerina school, but she failed unfortunately. This made her very sad, but she still loved ballerina concerts. When she is older, she has a son. Her son wants her to come visit him in Miami, but she often has an excuse for not coming, saying too much paperwork. One day, her son uses ballerina concert tickets to convince her to fly over. The tickets work very effect on Isabelle. She felt the sudden need to go. Isabelle and her son go to the performance, where Isabelle sees that she loved the way the ballerinas danced but the boys were too intense. After the performance, everyone claps instead of Isabelle.

Trap-jaw ants evolved extremely powerful jaws, capable of opening almost to a 180 degree angle and of closing so powerfully their structure causes them to decelerate in order to avoid hurting the ant itself.  One notable feature of these jaws is the fact that the ants evolved a way to launch themselves into the air by striking their jaws against the ground, something which the passage compares to popping popcorn.  There are two major uses for this ability: the ants are capable of using them to escape danger and potentially reposition themselves to deal with the danger; and the ants are capable of launching themselves at an invader and tackling them out of the nest after grabbing them.  This ability appears to have developed by accident, the result of the ants hitting their heads against the ground, but it now is a major part of their ability to survive.

Trap-jaw ants have evolved extremely powerful jaws, capable of opening to almost a 180 degree angle and closing fast enough that their structure actually forces them to decelerate in order to prevent the ant from hurting itself.  These jaws also allow the ants to make use of an unusual defensive feature: by striking their jaws against the ground, they can launch themselves into the air.  This allows them to temporarily escape from danger and reposition themselves.  It also allows them to tackle a target, potentially hard enough to launch the target with them.  This can be use to expel intruders from the ant's nest.  Unusually, this ability might have evolved by accident, with the ant discovering they could do it after hitting their heads on the ground.

The author stated that people who get their news from television are more persuaded by the appearance of the news reporter, rather than the content of the message. According to the author, appearance means everything when it comes to news on television. They discussed how people are more likely to trust what a news anchor is saying based on their appearance. The better looking a news caster is, the more likely the audience will trust them. The author concluded that television is a superficial medium for presenting the news.

Since passage 2 was hard to focus while reading, although is format might prove beneficial for the reader to recall its structure (which effect I noticed in my attempt to answer the multiple-choice questions for passage 2--the parts of the passage where I extracted the answers seemed to be more clear in my mind and thus more easily picked out and recalled; whereas in passage 1, I could not remember which name correlated to wich section of the passage), the sheer amount of information which I can recall made me feel more confident in answering questions related to passage 1 than 2. 
Also, comparing the process of answering the first (writing) question for each passage, I found that question 1 for passage 1 was much less challenging. I think that this is because I structured the knowledge gained from passage 1 in a more linear and feed-forward way, quite similar to a causal chain, the format which most people write an expository piece; on the contrary, information in passage 2 seemed more distributed--I was not able to extract the complete causal relationship of passage 2 in the amount of time given for me to read it, and I had to form this logical relationship based on my own surmise. ","Experience from answering questions today supported my feeling from last week about this question, that the format of passage 2 would perhaps be useful in reviewing and note-taking. Passage 2, although harder to read, would be more easily recalled in a content-addressed manner--that is, not completely in free writing but given the prompts in multiple-choice questions.

Here are two anecdotal evidences. First, the time it took me to read the first and second passages were different: as I remember, I think that I spent around 6 minutes reading the first passage, while I spent around 10 minutes reading the second passage. Second, I felt that in the first trial, answering questions for the second passage was much more involved in going back to the passage and extracting the answer, where for the first passage the answers came generally from my memory; on the subsequent trials, the memory of the passages were not as important because I remembered many of the questions and their answers.

Pesonally, I feel that when I was responding to questions (especially the writing response) about passage 2, I felt a bit of an unease; this was because that I was doubting whether the logical chain which I formed to answer the questions was the same as the passage's--I was trying to reverse-engineer the logic based on my field of ideas, while on contrast for passage 1 I obtained this logical chain when I was reading and remembering.

The authors presented a case in which a female TV host was fired because of her appearance to illustrate the audience's trust and preference for more attractive narrators.

However, passage 1 is much easier to read than passage 2, to which I might attribute to attention (which I discussed in the former question) and familiarity with this form of communication. Also, comparing passage 1 to plain text, I feel that it gives me a easier glance at the complete picture of the passage, and therefore it is easier to follow its logic and easier for me to retrieve information after reading; however, a caveat is that I would be more easily guided or misguided by the author who summarized the logical connections of the first passage (which might or might not be accurate and/ or biased).

The authors shows evidence that when the presenters on TV programs are more appealing in their appearance, the audience is more likely to trust them; this trust is less correlated to the general trustworthiness of the TV program or the presenter's abilities. The authors also give an example to demonstrate this effect: in the 1980s, a female reporter for a TV program was fired mostly because that the audience reported that she was not an effective presenter, while the reason is that he",,2022/05/02 19:17:44,9,1,146,29.336033333333333,H2,Both,2022/05/02 19:30:53,,"I still think that passage 1 was the easier to read, and my reasons have been yet unchanged.

Also, comparing the process of answering the first (writing) question for each passage, I found that question 1 for passage 1 was much less challenging. I think that this is because I structured the knowledge gained from passage 1 in a more linear and feed-forward way, quite similar to a causal chain, the format which most people write an expository piece; on the contrary, information in passage 2 seemed more distributed--I was not able to extract the complete causal relationship of passage 2 in the amount of time given for me to read it, and I had to form this logical relationship based on my own surmise. ","Experience from answering questions today supported my feeling from last week about this question, that the format of passage 2 would perhaps be useful in reviewing and note-taking. Passage 2, although harder to read, would be more easily recalled in a content-addressed manner--that is, not completely in free writing but given the prompts in multiple-choice questions.

However, in classes where I'm reading a shorter articles or texts with less technical jargon, the format of the first passage is faster and easier for me since I don't spend as much time with definitions and focus more on the big picture.

People watching the news care less and less about the content of the news and are more likely to pay attention to a reporter based on how attractive they are. The passage called these reporters ""talking hairdos"" showing how much consumers of media are obsessed with outward appearance and aesthetic as opposed to the content of what is being presented. This, along with shorter attention spans and limited air time, there is very little time for news to be taken seriously in TV. This is also affected by phrases like ""now this"" which rapidly shift the viewers' focus from one topic to the next, allowing very little time to actually pay attention to the news.

The passage about Reena had a lot more little details to remember and so the boxes with little bits of information was easier to understand after seeing the example and getting some time with it. The passage about television had more paragraphs that connected the causes/effects between ideas and the structure of the boxes with the arrows showing that relationship made more sense because the passage had big ideas to convey instead of specific details. Things like books Reena read, or qualities of her parents were more specific and the smaller boxes with less information in each made it easier to see and relate them to each other. In the TV passage, I liked that it was easy to see the Christine Craft example in a box that came after the talking hairdos reference to show the funnel from big/broad ideas to narrower more specific examples. ","For me, it depends on the type of information being presented. Like I said, this is very similar to how I take notes and I found that in classes with a lot more specific, small details, such as my Biochemistry class, I find that a chart with more boxes and arrows with less information in each box makes sense because I can see the connection and each detail gets the space and arrows it needs to show that relationship. In the Reena diagram, there was a lot of detail to remember and read that was very specific so this format made sense to give each detail the spotlight. In my psychology classes, I find that a diagram like the TV one is better able to show how big ideas are related to one another and I can see cause and effect. This diagram still allows for information, but I spend much less time on very specific or tiny details and more on the study as a whole, its findings, and the effect on what phenomena I'm studying.

People are also more likely to take newscasters seriously if they are attractive. The passage mentioned ""talking hairdos"" which really highlighted how much of a role physical appearance plays in the number of people watching the news.

The Reena passage had more specific and small details that were important to the story and the chart arranged this information well by breaking it up. During both tests and written responses, I could see in my head where the information was in the charts and I could visualize where to ""look"" for information because they organized it efficiently for what they presented. I do not think I would have had as easy of a time if the TV passage was organized like the Reena passage and vice versa. With large blocks of text, I tend to skip around and gloss over details and the Reena passage did not allow me to do that. The TV passage also broke the passage down and each box contained related information so I felt like I read a lot more carefully and was able to use other information in the box to piece together what I had forgotten. ","It depends on the information I'm learning. Like I mentioned, I've used both formats when making notes for myself and it depends on if I'm organizing big ideas or detailed information that determines which representation I lean towards. I find that in classes with a lot of vocabulary/parts, the Reena passage format makes sense. When I was learning about the citric acid cycle in biochemistry, this format worked because I could see the order through which substrates were made but also I could see what else these parts related to, like if they showed up in other processes or had other functions. I could add definitions and elaborate as I needed and show relationships with this format without being overwhelmed by the information. Conversely, in my psychology classes, I found a format like passage 1 to be more helpful because often times the vocabulary/specific details didn't require as much effort as being able to relate a concept to a study or see large scale relationships between ideas.

","Depending on the situation I think that both formats have a lot of value in my learning. As I mentioned, I usually make visual diagrams of the texts I read in my notes to help me understand and in classes with heavy scientific readings, I've found I lean more towards the style of passage 2 because there are so many definitions and complex relationships. However, in classes where I'm reading a shorter articles or texts with less technical jargon, the format of the first passage is faster and easier for me since I don't spend as much time with definitions and focus more on the big picture. In my biochemistry class, I found making a visual like the one in passage 2 helped me see how processes happened and add in definitions and where certain organelles or enzymes connected to other processes in the body. Conversely, in my education classes where I learned about the school system, the format of passage 1 more closely resembled my notes since I wasn't focused on specific definitions but rather relationships and causes/effects as a whole.

She was able to go by this new nickname by staring pointedly at people or refusing to answer when they called her Doreen. The narrator and Doreen grew up together and their families were from the West Indies. The narrator sees Reena as an adult at the funeral of her Aunt Vi, the narrator's godmother and whom Reena loved. Reena still has the same confidence she always had as a child, and the narrator reflects on his interesting relationship with her growing up. Reena had a very strict mother and a father who did not pay attention to her. She is described as being overwhelming to everyone she met, which is how she was able to stand out against her half dozen siblings.

The passage about Reena had a lot more little details to remember and so the boxes with little bits of information was easier to understand after seeing the example and getting some time with it. The passage about television had more paragraphs that connected the causes/effects between ideas and the structure of the boxes with the arrows showing that relationship made more sense because the passage had big ideas to convey instead of specific details. Things like books Reena read, or qualities of her parents were more specific and the smaller boxes with less information in each made it easier to see and relate them to each other. In the TV passage, I liked that it was easy to see the Christine Craft example in a box that came after the talking hairdos reference to show the funnel from big/broad ideas to narrower more specific examples. ","For me, it depends on the type of information being presented. Like I said, this is very similar to how I take notes and I found that in classes with a lot more specific, small details, such as my Biochemistry class, I find that a chart with more boxes and arrows with less information in each box makes sense because I can see the connection and each detail gets the space and arrows it needs to show that relationship. In the Reena diagram, there was a lot of detail to remember and read that was very specific so this format made sense to give each detail the spotlight. In my psychology classes, I find that a diagram like the TV one is better able to show how big ideas are related to one another and I can see cause and effect. This diagram still allows for information, but I spend much less time on very specific or tiny details and more on the study as a whole, its findings, and the effect on what phenomena I'm studying. Looking back, however, I felt like I remembered more of the Reena passage since I remembered a lot of tiny boxes."

To get people to embrace the change, she'd stare or point at them. The narrator sees Reena again at the funeral of his godmother, Reena's Aunt Vi. Reena has not changed, and walks in like she owns the place. The narrator and Reena grew up together and their families were close and they were both from the West Indies. The narrator describes Reena as being able to overwhelm everyone she meets which is how she stood out amongst her half a dozen siblings. Her father was absent and ignored Reena, while her mother was very strict. The narrator also talks about how Reena was interested in historical figures growing up, such as Hitler, and read complex books while he was still reading books for children his age.

The passage about TV had bigger ideas and the chart organized them in a way that made sense for how the paragraphs were organized. The Reena passage had more specific and small details that were important to the story and the chart arranged this information well by breaking it up. During both tests and written responses, I could see in my head where the information was in the charts and I could visualize where to ""look"" for information because they organized it efficiently for what they presented. I do not think I would have had as easy of a time if the TV passage was organized like the Reena passage and vice versa. With large blocks of text, I tend to skip around and gloss over details and the Reena passage did not allow me to do that. The TV passage also broke the passage down and each box contained related information so I felt like I read a lot more carefully and was able to use other information in the box to piece together what I had forgotten. ","It depends on the information I'm learning. Like I mentioned, I've used both formats when making notes for myself and it depends on if I'm organizing big ideas or detailed information that determines which representation I lean towards. I find that in classes with a lot of vocabulary/parts, the Reena passage format makes sense. When I was learning about the citric acid cycle in biochemistry, this format worked because I could see the order through which substrates were made but also I could see what else these parts related to, like if they showed up in other processes or had other functions. I could add definitions and elaborate as I needed and show relationships with this format without being overwhelmed by the information. Conversely, in my psychology classes, I found a format like passage 1 to be more helpful because often times the vocabulary/specific details didn't require as much effort as being able to relate a concept to a study or see large scale relationships between ideas.

Despite the rejection, she continued to go to the performances and found that even though she felt sad, she was very happy to watch the performances. She had a son who was in Miami, he wanted his mother to visit him but Alice often refused because she thought that the performances were must better in Cuba. Her son Alejandro came up with an idea to surprise her and buy tickets to a performance that he knew she would not be able to see in Cuba.

The ants are able to slam their jaws on the ground which propels them in (a generally uncontrollable in the sense that they don't know what direction it is sometimes) an overhead direction which gives them an escape but also a new perspective for attack. They also can hit the ground and propel their attacker and themselves in opposite directions. Their jaws have a slowing-down mechanism so that the power of the jaws slamming together does not hurt the ants. Their jaws are so powerful that they can also break the shells of harder-to-attack creatures, including other types of ants.

It's also easier to remember the formation or image of the 5-6 box diagram rather than a diagram with 20 little boxes. It's easier to chunk the information with less boxes too.

He is in full support of zoos, but empathizes with the critics who say that zoos spend more resources when breeding animals and not enough to fight habitat destruction, which they see as the true threat to species in the wild. 
Regarding pandas, Dr. Wang is shown to have positive feelings toward them. For one, he was very happy when he watched a youtube video of a panda mother taking care of her cub. According to Wang, the black and white fur on the pandas represent yin and yang, or a link between light and dark. Wang connects the fur to a link that needs to be made in real life.  
Dr. Wang made contributions to the National Zoo's new panda exhibit, which involved making the environment similar to the pandas' natural habitat in the wild. Another thing included in the exhibit are decision stands, which serve to bring awareness to visitors about the dangers of habitat destruction and the purpose of conservation biology.

Passage 2 contains fewer boxes and the format of passage 2 illustration the information along with the timeline. There are also fewer main words (on the arrows) which make it easier to keep track of the information and which paragraphs are important.,I believe both formats can benefit the academic learning.

The passage brings up the ""now..then"" statement stating that when this statement is presented, it is most likely to say what the information we watched wasn't important and then brings up something they consider important, which is most likely irrelant. Additionally, the television industry is very corrupted in the sense that who they hire is mostly based on looks. The people that we see on television are usually hired because of their appearance.

The Now this format may be so that viewers can join the broadcast at any time and not miss too much due to a lack of continuity.
Each segment is approximately 8 minutes long so that they don't lose the viewer's attention and so that new people joining can follow the next story even if they missed the context for this one.

When answering the comprehension questions, for Passage 2 it was easier to determine where to look because I know what the topic of each box is for Passage 1 I tried to reference back to the flow chart if I was confused about an answer but then I just decided to go off of memory because I didn't know where to look and I'd waste too much time searching for it. Passage 1 was not only hard to reference it was difficult to read in the first place as it lost the flow of a typical sentence I found myself rereading the previous box or words on the arrow because not only to the sentences divide at the intro they also divided at the subject and sometimes they divided at the verb so it was hard to separate one thought from another in Passage 1. I used my mouse less for Passage 2 because it was easier to follow the flow of a sentence but for Passage 1 I had to use my mouse to help my eyes follow the flow of a sentence.  That being said I think I read Passage 1 faster than I read Passage 2, but I think I understood Passage 2 better. ","I think sometimes it's hard to organize topics or ideas by themes of main ideas in academic readings, especially for classes like History or English. This format sort of pre-organizes them for you. This way even when reviewing for an exam or just for the sake of better understanding a subject, if I know where I struggle I can just reread that box or branch of boxes rather than search through the entire passage to find the concept I am struggling with. I already use a similar strategy by highlighting different themes or main ideas in different colors but even then one paragraph may have multiple colors in it this format organizes the passage by theme so it is easier to process."

He says that the now this phrase makes it so that stories are not connected and that one segment is completely unrelated to another or at least makes the viewer feel like they are.
The author also believes that the Now This 8 minute segments make it so that people don't get to fully process the information given to them, in that even if the topic is something serious like murder or natural disaster the segment ends in 8 mins and then it's on to the next story.
The author says that the 8 minute segments are designed so that a viewer can join in at anytime and not feel too far behind or lack context because even if the viewer joined halfway through one story in just a short while there will be a completely new story and the viewer wont have to be confused.
The author also says that the news anchors have to be attractive, he had a case of one female reporter who got fired because of what she believes as sexism and her not meeting the cultures beauty standards.
The author says the news anchors are talking hairdos in that they have to look good and that this sentiment is not new. In ancient times people who deliver bad news were punished so in order to make it so that the bad news giver is not hated having them be attractive helps.

I didn't like Passage 1 because of the way it was organized. Passage 2 was much better organized. I liked how there were a few sentences in each box that made it so that thought was contained neatly. Each box felt like it represented an instance or a theme, so it was easier to understand too. The sentences weren't fragmented allowing me to process each sentence properly without getting it confused with a nearby sentence either. 

Another thing that makes it a little harder to answer this question is that the two Passages were different types, if both Passage 1 and Passage 2 were narratives or if both were informational, then the two would be more comparable, Passage 1 was much more accessible to a normal person than Passage 2 because the characters in Passage 2 are so unfamiliar I was reading it but I didn't care about it at all. Passage 1 I had more personal connection to it as I was reading it I was thinking ohh yeah the people who do local news are attractive the news segments are only about 8 minutes long even as I was watching the news on Wednesday evening I was thinking about it I can assure you that I wasn't thinking about Reena. Even though Passage 1 was incredibly hard to read due to it's formatting I might have scored better on those tests just because the material was more relatable and therefore formed stronger connection in my brain I was connected to Passage 1, Passage 2 was about random people I don't know and can't relate to it doesn't stick as well regardless of the format so I wouldn't be surprised if I remember less from it today even though I felt I understood it better when I read it on Wednesday. If both Passage are the same type narrative or informational and we did this study again I feel like the results for which type of formating is better might be clearer but that's just my opinion.","I think Passage 2 for the same reason I stated before, it looks like it is organized by theme so that would be very helpful in academic learning for subjects such as English when writing a summary of a book I just read or for history when trying to break down the aspects of the topic just covered. It also doesn't break off too many times which is nice. Another thing I liked about Passage 2 was that it wasn't always sequential, Passage one had a lot of circular box systems that seems like it's describing a series of events but it's hard to tell which is the starting event because there were so many breaks but Passage 2 had one central box and multiple boxes branching off of it and I think that can be very useful for a class like History because I'm thinking about a lesson I recently had on the causes of WW1 that's not just a series of sequential events there are multiple reasons each having their own sequence but all centralized to one thing I think Passage 2 style will be a great knowledge representation for that where each box can be a reason, in it explain what the reason is, then branch a box off of each of the reason boxes to say this caused this which caused this and explain each box. Don't break the boxes midsentence that's confusing. Even for my neuroscience courses Passage 2 can be a great way for me to practice and review my knowledge on things like learning and memory or sleep because those are conceptual topics. "

The appearance of the newscaster is also important which is shown through the author's description of them as talking hairdos. 
More attractive anchors are often chosen to represent the news on TV because if the person looks pleasing to the average person the people are more likely to keep watching and this was demonstrated in the case of the one reporter I think her name was Cindy something. She sued the news station on the basis of sexism because she believed that she was fired because of her appearance. 
The author thinks that jumping to a new segment regardless of whether the previous segment included serious things like death, or natural disaster is harmful in that the quick changes in topic don't allow us to properly process what happened.",,2022/06/01 14:01:48,9,1,112,22.05303333333333,H2,H2,2022/06/01 14:16:52,2022/06/01 14:09:57,Passage 2 had fewer abrupt breaks. It had a nicer flow because it didn't break in the middle of a sentence as Passage 1 did. I liked how Passage 2 was broken up by idea rather than by every few words seemingly at random like Passage 1. I think Passage 2 was also easier to read because it was a narrative that is easier to follow than the facts presented in the piece that was a critique.,I think I'd like Passage 2 for my academic learning because it is organized by the main idea or topic. That is helpful because it helps me mentally categorize information better so that when I recall it I can recall all related things too because it's pregrouped. Another reason Passage 2 would be helpful is because it was able to show how one thing led to another like for the narrator feeling unwelcomed because Reena was impatient that was after we learned about how she didn't have raw edges and was reading all this grown-up stuff about Hitler so hearing how the narrator felt after learning about Reena made it stick better and that was because of the sequence.

The narrator and Reena don't talk in the passage but upon Reena's entrance the narrator begins to reflect on her childhood with Reena and relive some of the memories.
Reena enters the church with confidence which is a trait she carries fmo her childhood. She decided to change her name from Doreen to Reena and demanded people call her her preferred name by not responding to her old name, correcting people who misreferenced her, and staring and pointing at them. Reena and the narrator weren't meant to be friends or at least weren't friends naturally since they didn't have a ton of common interests, Reena was very into history and Mature topics such as Hitler's invasion of Poland or Spains Civil War at the age of 12 but the narrarator was more into age appropriate literature. The narrator also thinks that Reena is beautiful but age does show on her face a little. The narrator then reflects on Reena's family and how her dad was funny but kept her a a distance, her mother strict forceful but also equally fun and effective. Reena was overwhelming even with siblings she acted like an only child. Reena treated the narrator poorly cuz she was impatient with the narrator. The narrator felt less than when she was around Reena.

When answering the comprehension questions, for Passage 2 it was easier to determine where to look because I know what the topic of each box is for Passage 1 I tried to reference back to the flow chart if I was confused about an answer but then I just decided to go off of memory because I didn't know where to look and I'd waste too much time searching for it. Passage 1 was not only hard to reference it was difficult to read in the first place as it lost the flow of a typical sentence I found myself rereading the previous box or words on the arrow because not only to the sentences divide at the intro they also divided at the subject and sometimes they divided at the verb so it was hard to separate one thought from another in Passage 1. I used my mouse less for Passage 2 because it was easier to follow the flow of a sentence but for Passage 1 I had to use my mouse to help my eyes follow the flow of a sentence.  That being said I think I read Passage 1 faster than I read Passage 2, but I think I understood Passage 2 better. ","I think sometimes it's hard to organize topics or ideas by themes of main ideas in academic readings, especially for classes like History or English. This format sort of pre-organizes them for you. This way even when reviewing for an exam or just for the sake of better understanding a subject, if I know where I struggle I can just reread that box or branch of boxes rather than search through the entire passage to find the concept I am struggling with. I already use a similar strategy by highlighting different themes or main ideas in different colors but even then one paragraph may have multiple colors in it this format organizes the passage by theme so it is easier to process."

Reena walks in with a lot of confidence almost as if shes the one officiating the funeral. The narrator recall memories of her childhood with Reena. One of the instances she recalled was of how Reena's real name was something like Noreena (i can't remember) but she wanted everyone to call her Reena so she'd correct them if they used the wrong name, refuse to respond to her old name, glare at people if they used the wrong name, and stomp her feet. This shows that she is an assertive character. The narrator also says that Reena has aged well. Then the narrator continues to reflect on how she and Reena aren't alike and how they wouldn't have been friends if it weren't for their mothers being friends. She talked about how Reena seemed more grown than her because she'd read and talk about Hitler's invasion of Poland, and the Civil War in Spain. Meanwhile the narrator was still captivated by books meant for her age. She said that Reena was impatient with her and made her feel less than. She also recalled how Reena's dad humored her but also kept her at a distance, Reena was not an only child but commanded attention as if she were. Reena's mother was effective and fun. ",,2022/05/28 13:38:41,10,1,103,32.20831666666667,H2,H2,2022/05/28 13:56:46,,"Because the breaks in the passage weren't so frequent, when I read Passage 1 on Wednesday it was so hard to even follow because the sentences broke and branched off at like every few words making me have to use my mouse to trace a line through each sentence so that my eyes don't get lost in the mess. I didn't like Passage 1 because of the way it was organized. Passage 2 was much better organized. I liked how there were a few sentences in each box that made it so that thought was contained neatly. Each box felt like it represented an instance or a theme, so it was easier to understand too. The sentences weren't fragmented allowing me to process each sentence properly without getting it confused with a nearby sentence either. 

Another thing that makes it a little harder to answer this question is that the two Passages were different types, if both Passage 1 and Passage 2 were narratives or if both were informational, then the two would be more comparable, Passage 1 was much more accessible to a normal person than Passage 2 because the characters in Passage 2 are so unfamiliar I was reading it but I didn't care about it at all. Passage 1 I had more personal connection to it as I was reading it I was thinking ohh yeah the people who do local news are attractive the news segments are only about 8 minutes long even as I was watching the news on Wednesday evening I was thinking about it I can assure you that I wasn't thinking about Reena. Even though Passage 1 was incredibly hard to read due to it's formatting I might have scored better on those tests just because the material was more relatable and therefore formed stronger connection in my brain I was connected to Passage 1, Passage 2 was about random people I don't know and can't relate to it doesn't stick as well regardless of the format so I wouldn't be surprised if I remember less from it today even though I felt I understood it better when I read it on Wednesday. If both Passage are the same type narrative or informational and we did this study again I feel like the results for which type of formating is better might be clearer but that's just my opinion.","I think Passage 2 for the same reason I stated before, it looks like it is organized by theme so that would be very helpful in academic learning for subjects such as English when writing a summary of a book I just read or for history when trying to break down the aspects of the topic just covered. It also doesn't break off too many times which is nice. Another thing I liked about Passage 2 was that it wasn't always sequential, Passage one had a lot of circular box systems that seems like it's describing a series of events but it's hard to tell which is the starting event because there were so many breaks but Passage 2 had one central box and multiple boxes branching off of it and I think that can be very useful for a class like History because I'm thinking about a lesson I recently had on the causes of WW1 that's not just a series of sequential events there are multiple reasons each having their own sequence but all centralized to one thing I think Passage 2 style will be a great knowledge representation for that where each box can be a reason, in it explain what the reason is, then branch a box off of each of the reason boxes to say this caused this which caused this and explain each box. Don't break the boxes midsentence that's confusing. Even for my neuroscience courses Passage 2 can be a great way for me to practice and review my knowledge on things like learning and memory or sleep because those are conceptual topics. "

This is because we can simultaneously focus on other chunks such as watching TV while sending texts. However, it is conceded that what's written can be effective in bonding people together and the content of communication is not very different from other forms of communication.

For one, supporters deem it an indispensable element that appears salient in the American history in the form of books, movies and cultural elements. The mention of the period before War of Independence aims to illustrate how forms of communication can preserve and record history. Also, text messaging is a quicker and more intimate way of communication as it saves the time for organizing incomplete thoughts. It  helps us reach the number of people our ancestors could not in their entire period of lifetime, too. However, critics like Fields suggest that it limits the realm of human's other experiences. Also, while we text others, we might be less concentrated and split our attention to other simultaneous activities such as TV-watching or chitchatting. But they concede that what is written in text messages are similar to what's conveyed in other forms of communication, so the effects might be the same in the long run.

This is what's making reporting news on television more of an ""art form"" and not the blunt, specific, and serious media that it's supposed to be. For an example the writer brought up a woman who was rudely removed from her spot on television because her face wasn't ""pleasing"" enough to watch, because sadly, people are inclined to believe and trust a person with a pretty face than a person with features they deem unattractive.

Thus I'm saying that Passage 2 made me ""lazy"" and ""exhausted"" mentally, and that's why I don't believe it will be good for me academically, in hindsight. As for Passage 1, it would required a lot of reading and rereading to cement those details in my mind, as I can easily discard or miss certain things due to the size of the paragraphs. The main idea I could grasp, but any other details--such as Christine Craft's name that I failed to remember each and every time--would escape me. "

It got the point that even her father avoided her, due to the fact that she was difficult to interact with. Reena was selfish, as she acted like an only child even though she had many siblings. The narrator felt overpowered by Reena due to the fact that Reena was knowledgeable about many topics, such as WW2. Reena and the narrator met again at the narrator's godmother's funeral (Aunt Vi).

However, I do think that the text that connected the Reena passage (i.e. words such as ""which led to"" or ""so she was"") made the relationships between the nodes easier to visualize. I found the first passage harder to read than the second as it presented the information in larger chunks, which relied on me to produce the connections which were displayed in the Reena passage via the connective text. ","When it comes to the ease of understanding, I think passage 2 does a better job in the sense that it allows the reader to visually see the connection between the nodes. As stated previously, passage 1 presents more information with less connective statements, which relies on the reader to create. If the reader doesn't make the connections that the text intends to create, the visualization of that information is more difficult to retain. Whereas with the second passage, the connections are already presented for the reader, and thus the interconnectedness within the passage is easier to visualize. "
