The escape jump has the ant slamming its face on the ground, which propels the ant to a point where it may better attack the intruder in its nest and/or the ant's pray. The defense jump has the ant slamming its face against its enemy, which both forces the enemy out of the ants nest, and propels the ant also out of the nest, or in the opposite direction of the enemy.

The jaws functioned by storing large amounts of energy within the jaw muscles that allowed the jaw to close at extremely fast speeds. Researchers who study this species of ant recalled that trying to catch this ant was like trying to catch popping pop corn, because when they encountered an intruder or researcher, they would be jumping all around, impossible to catch. Researchers also mentioned that because of their powerful jaw, getting bit by one of the ants was particularly painful. The passage mentioned that their jaw and bite was so powerful, it was able to crack the exoskeletons of their pray so that they were easily able to access the meat inside. There are two types of jumps that the passage mentioned: a defense jump and an escape jump. The defense jump worked with the ant slamming its face and jaw against the ground to launch it into the air. This is done so that the ant could reach a better vantage point to attack its enemy.

It uses this energy to either attack interlopers or to escape therefrom. The attacking bite sends the interloper in one direction and the ant in some other direction, while the escape bite simply flings the ant in an unknown, presumably unpredictable, direction.

The researchers studying the ant, having taken video recordings of this ability in action, discovered that the mandible slows down prior to full closure, an aspect they consider to be a self-protection mechanism to avoid the force damaging their own body.

The strength of the bite also allows the ant to crush through thick or strongly shelled prey.

The ant can shut its jaw at speeds of, like, a hundred and forty miles an hour, though the jaw slows down slightly near the end so as to prevent harm to the ant itself.

The ant can make an escape jump by slamming its jaw into the ground.

The ant's jaw stores up energy, akin to an archer pulling back the string on a bow, so that when loosed, it goes super fast and super hard.

A group of researchers studied this and also apparently got bit by the ant as well, which hurt.

He had another piece with... someone else. This one was all quite good and I described as ""his body and soul"".

Jazz music was considered something that wasn't high class; it was something for dance parties, not for serious study.

Jazz as a musical genre was, at the time, limited by public opinion, in the sense that it was generally considered music for ""dance parties"" rather than ""school.""

Berry(? Barry?) was also limited as a musician for this reason, due to technological(? or was it logistical?) constraints with regard to recording studios and the like.

However, he possessed great musical adaptability and could make music that blended perfectly into the background. One of his major works was even described as a ""cathedral"" of music for the image it could paint in the reader's mind.

Likely, these ants evolved to learn these strategies through trial and error, i.e. accidentally learning about them. The ants used the energy stored in their jaws to break through the tough shells of the other animals they wanted to eat. Similarly, the ants used their jaws to either jump away from attackers or to hit the attacker, which both propels the attacker and the ant. The amount of force used by these ants is astounding, which is why their attacks are extremely powerful and can either launch them 10 ant lengths in the air or horizontally backward by a foot.

These ants use their jaws in two ways: 1) in defense against predators and 2) when breaking open the shells of animals they plan to consume.

First, by exerting a force that launches the predator and the ant away from each other in two separate directions, or by exerting a force that launches the ant high (about a foot) into the air. Research has shown that it is likely the ants learned these techniques through trial and error. They are able to use their jaws in this way due to the large amount of energy stored in their jaw, which is wedged open at about 180 degrees.

Berry's excellent abilities are not well known due to his lack of access to recording studios during his era and the lack of interest in the swing genre at that time. He spent most of the beginning of his career as a loner due to his genial  part of the Calloway group as a sideman. A sideman is a musician who typically only works to further the careers of those around them by working as background musicians, rather than for their own career goals. Sidemen are akin to traveling salesmen. Despite his lack of notoriety, Berry did have a few successful moments later in his career. This occurred when he was given the opportunity of preforming a solo during a concert, one time with the Calloway group and another time without them. Each of these solos only lasted about 30-45 seconds by the quality of his musicianship shone through.

These ants have jaws that can be opened up to 180 degrees wide, and can be instantly snap shut with a powerful bite that can pierce through prey's armor. Their jaws decelerate briefly to prevent them from injuring themselves. These ants don't live in traditional ant hills. There were two distinct attacks that the researchers were able to note that the ants make use of. One is the escape jump, which allows the ant to jump very high in a random direction away from an intruder, in order to reposition themselves for a potential counter attack. The other is the bounce-defense jump, which involves the ant using propulsion from their jaw to launch an intruder away from their nest (if the intruder is small enough), while also launching back the attacker. The ants have been compared to popping popcorn, as they jump in a frenzy whenever they are approached by an invader to their home.",a,a,d,d,b,c,d,a,c,,Sat Sep 04 2021 18:17:56 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),9,1,558,Tue Sep 07 2021 20:44:06 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),18,0.20454545454545456,0.5597325188077225,Tue Sep 07 2021 20:39:43 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),261,"The Jaws That Jump is a passage about a specific species of ants that has evolved to have very powerful jaws that can be used for propulsion and hunting prey. Researchers have compared these ants to popcorn, as they jump around frantically when they are approached by an intruder. The force of the ant's powerful jaw is able to break through the shells of most of their prey, and it is able to prevent harm on the ant itself by decelerating slightly before coming to a complete stop. Researchers described two specific uses that the ant have for their propulsion abilities. In one case, ants are able to propel themselves up in a random direction when approached by a threat, which allows the ant to assess the situation, and potentially land in a spot better suited for counter attacking. In the other case, the ant is able to apply significant force on its opponent, and if it is small enough, the opponent will be launched out of the nest.

There are two types of jumps the ants perform with their powerful jaws, the escape jump and a second type of jump.

In the second type of jump, the ants propel both themselves and the intruder out of their nest (which is made out of leaves). On the other hand, in the escape jump, the ant just propels itself.

The second is their ""bouncer-defense"", whereby they expel attackers out of their nest by slamming into them.  This also sends the ant flying! 

The third is their escape-jump, which they use when another being intrudes on their nest.  They jump high into the air, allowing them to live another day, or even setting up another attack on the intruder.  

Though they are both aerial techniques, the bouncer defense and the escape jump most likely evolved separately.

First, they have the ability to store kinetic energy in their jaw muscles to an extraordinary degree---they can open their jaws up to 150 degrees and snap them shut at up to 135 miles per hour.  They use this for predation, and also as a defense mechanism—when other animals intrude on their hives, which they construct in piles of loose leaves on the floor of the region where they live, they go after them.

They also have the capability to perform an escape jump, which helps them escape from predators.  When they're defending their hive, this gives them the incidental ability to move to new positions whence to bite their attackers.

Finally, they do what the article called a ""bouncer defense""—they slam into intruders and send both them and the ant flying.

Their bite is known to be hot and sting because of the release of the energy within their jaws is fast enough to heat up the surrounding area. Their mandibles allowed for them to jump away to confuse and attack a prey at a different direction or attack them and shoot them both in opposite directions.

This allows for them to bite through well defended/armored prey and get to the good juicy bits inside. They have energy stored in their jaws and release them, which also produce heat from the speed (causing a hot and painful bite). I think it was their jaws that were developed over a lineage of ants through evolution. They also had two different jumping mechanics, where the escape jump allowed for them to throw themselves in a random direction (through their jaws I believe but I could be wrong) in order to confuse their attacker/prey and launch an attack quickly afterwards. I also know there was a method in which they launched themselves at the prey/attacker and if small enough would launch the prey in one direction and themselves in the other.

This likely came about due to evolution and some of the mechanisms they use came about by accident. The attack is so strong because the mandibles store energy that is used for that specific attack. The ants tend to jump around a lot as part of the attack and are hard to catch in a research lab as a result. They have two primary jumps. One is to escape and the other is as a defensive mechanism. The escape is about propelling themselves away from harm and repositioning themselves into a way to attack back. This likely came about by accident but was found useful for survival. The defensive attack propels an intruder away from their nest and themselves a shorter distance horizontally. This is the more well known jump/attack they have.,a,a,d,d,b,c,d,a,c,,Tue Aug 31 2021 19:23:43 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),9,1,597,Fri Sep 03 2021 23:05:05 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),14,0.1590909090909091,0.5598044706202278,Fri Sep 03 2021 23:01:55 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),188,"""The Jaws That Jump"" was a passage about trap-jaw ants and how they use their jaws.

When they use their jaws in such a way, the ants jump around and are hard to catch for research as a result. The jumping itself is a mechanism they use to get away from an attacking animal and reposition themselves for their next attack or as a way to move an animal away from their nests by propelling them through the force they use.

They initially assumed that they were artifacts from transmission interference, but they were so common that they created another hypothesis to explain them: meteors made of water. Based on the frequency of these meteors, they noted that they would add inches to global water levels each year. However, this hypothesis was met critically by the scientific community. Though Frank's other contributions were still respected, the meteor hypothesis was ridiculed. Once more supporting information was discovered, the scientific community began to accept Frank's meteor hypothesis as a potential explanation. The hypothesis has not been entirely confirmed but has now garnered greater credibility.

It doesn't hurt itself because the mandible decelerates once it approaches to closing. It's in South America. It has two types of jumps, the defensive bounce and the escape jump. The escape jump is used to evade a predator (like a lizard's tongue) by slamming its mandibles against the ground, making it unpredictable. It was likely evolved on accident and the passage had the best way to phrase it ""the only time where banging ur head against the ground was a good thing"" (something like that). It also gives the ant another chance for a counterattack by moving to a new location. Meanwhile, the bounce jump propels the ant and even the imposter of the nest (if light enough) in opposite directions.

The trap-jaw ant has enough force to get through prey that has hard exterior or to attack intruders in their nests. They have two different jumps, the defend bounce jump and the escape jump. The escape jump was done by banging its head against the ground (the only good thing that came around from banging head against floor, as the passage says) and it lets the ant make a fast unexpected move to avoid the sticky tongue of a lizard and gives it the opportunity to regroup for another attack.
