The first was is a method used for the aunt to get an advantage on its opponent, snapping its jaw, which launches it in the air, allowing it to get to a vantage point.

Also Passage two was able to show a brief overview of what the passage was about but with an option to click on the links for detailed information, which is easier for me to get around and understand. The only thing helpful I found in passage one was the headers which is already present in current passages that we use today.,I find passage two helpful for my academic learning becuase I was able to understand it which made me more interested in the passage. It made me want to learn more about it because it was such a smooth process for me. I don't think passage two would be helpful for my academic learning becuase it had a lot of information in one page and it's easier for me to take the information that I have in pages and read it in chuncks.

I think passage 1 was in paragraphs which was harder to take in at once especially for looking through at a short period of time. ,I find Passage 2 helpful for my academic learning because it was in chunks which is easier for me to read and it makes me memorize my topics better if I had a test or some questions to answer. I also liked how there were headers where I could click and know where the detailed information is when I needed it. ","I still think Passage 2 was easier to read because it was in chunks and it had simpler sentences. It had a way to go back and read detailed information which made it easier for me to go through the formats. I thought that Passage 1 was harder to read because it was in paragraph forms and although I could make it into chunks mysel, it would be easier if it was already present. ,I find Passage 2 helpful for my academic learning because it is easier for me to remember and then I will be able to answer the questions better and remember the story better.

I'm a visual learner, so when I read a paragraph it's stuff that I'm imagining that helps me remember. The smaller text blocks deprive from of that understanding. Also I believe there is some merit to a Horizontal flowing chart over a vertical one as that seemed to make me more comfortable.","Longer chunks allowed me to create a visual that helped me build context while i was reading. Scientific concepts are difficult for me to remember when I don't have an idea of it's purpose of application i.e. I am reading facts about the ant but have no idea of the relative importance of the links. The second passage on the other hand and a lot of filler language that let me piece things together. On second thought, I suspect that I might do better if there were shorter chunks for the ""The Quiet Sideman"" and longer chunks for the ""The Jaws That Jump"" to help me answer better. ,I think that byte-sized information like in passage 1 would be of greater help if I have a moderate grasp over the concept. E.g. I struggled to make sense of some of the terminologies in passage 1 and had no clue on how to associate one part to another even with the presence of links. In passage 2 however, the context was free of background knowledge or jargons that would block me from making all of it into a cohesive story to bear in mind. If I was revising, I'd go with passage1, If I was learning, it would be passage2. ",

That being said, I spent less time reading in passage 2 than passage 1. Instead, I looked for keywords in the question and tried to find them in one of the charts. I think my difficulty comes from merely not being accustomed to reading and processing information in the method used for passage 2. ,I think both methods are quite helpful. Passage 1 utilized a more typical format of short, concise sentences which I am more accustomed to. Perhaps this format might be useful for texts which require a deeper reading in order for optimal understanding and comprehension. However, while passage 2's format was certainly more difficult to follow, it was less taxing, given the nature multiple choice questions. I think if there were a short answer question on both passages, I would have an easier time answering questions about passage 1. ","As I wrote in the previous test, I found that the format of the first passage allowed for a more holistic and complete understanding of the passage. The second passage was formatted in a rather confusing way which promoted the search of keywords in order to find answers instead of actually reading. As far as benefits go, the second format might be more useful in things like reading passages for standardized tests were the goal is to merely answer the questions. Other than that, I think the format of the first passage is much easier to comprehend and remember information. ,The goal of learning is to explore new material and remember content that is central to the objectives of the class. Therefore, the format of the first passage would be the better choice as it allows for a holistic understanding of the material. The second format might also be useful, but only if the objective is to answer questions on a test. Even if the answers are more or less the same for both formats, I think information presented in the first format would be remembered for significantly longer, making it more ideal for academic learning. ","I think the format of passage 1 was much easier to read. Although the passage was arranged in a format I had little experience with reading, the way it was arranged allowed for mostly seamless transitions from one section of the article to next. In that way, it is most similar to the format of a typical reading. It allowed for consistent reading without having to rely on directional cues such as arrows to follow the passage.,I still think the first format yields better memory retention. The format of the second passage is too fragmented and distracting, making it necessary for the reader to analyze what the arrows mean in order to properly read the passage. The multiple choice questions act as a deterrent for the reader and direct them to look for keywords in the questions in the passage. The first format allowed consistent reading which I found was most helpful for a more complete understanding of the passage, which is what you want for academic learning. The format of the second passage would only be good for something like standardized tests where time and efficiency is heavily emphasized. "

He was talented and original but this skill was not broadly recognized because of how the music industry was structured and what accounted for popular taste at the time. Berry's early career was limited to short background roles in recordings. And while he performed with major singers, his role was still that of a supportive player.

Arrows helped illustrate the flow of the story + timeline,The chunks were visually memorable but just enough to pique my curiosity. The flow also made it easier to think about what I might want to learn further (about Berry for example) if a piece of information wasn't as easy to understand at first read. Thinking on timelines, the chart also makes it easier to remember the sequence of events (as opposed to a straight, horizontal line or a wall of text). The topic points at the upper left hand corners were helpful in retaining the main point of the text.","The jaw ant piece includes a lot of technical details, which involve illustrative language. You're visualizing the activity - the jumping, the jaw-slamming (that being the most memorable for me), etc. We all know what ants look like so it's easy to come up with imagery as you read along. 

Berry was an obscure musician so I couldn't put a face to the name. If this was an actual assignment of mine, I'd be looking up photos, listening to sound recordings, etc., to immerse myself in visuals. 

Oddly enough, the imagery was easier to recall in the first text and I was able to write more comfortably about the passage. I had a harder time answering the questions. With the second text, I was less comfortable recalling and free-writing but I was slightly more certain while answering questions.,For one, I think the left-to-right orientation of the first diagram helped but I can't say for sure why. There was more information/blocks of text in the first but the diagram was simpler - not so many paths to direct my attention to. I think the sections in the first were also more clearly labeled? Or maybe they were more descriptive as opposed to simple dates and names. ","The first representation was simpler - there were fewer pages to flip through and not as much back-and-forth between a topic and its sub-topics. I think too that the left-to-right reading helped. The text was more illustrative and allowed for imagery to build, which I think helped with retention. For example, I'm unlikely to forget the imagery of an ant slamming its jaws into the ground! 

There were also fewer connective lines to different topics. And the words linking the topics weren't just prepositions (""in"", ""by"", etc.) I think there was a clearer, more descriptive relationship between one topic box to the next. So overall, the first was more digestible.,I guess it would depend on exactly what I'm to be learning. The second text included dates, something I might depend on rote memorization for. I can't say for sure if the first format would be better for such knowledge; the first text was also about a creature I can easily assign an image to in my mind, whereas I wasn't familiar with the main character in the second text. 

But I do think the first format was simply more digestible. I tended to go back and forth between sections to get a better sense of the relationship between ideas and the second representation was a little tedious to do so. So, even though there was more text in each box in the first, the less involved, less detailed format helped."

The author pointed out that studies have shown that people were more likely to trust a new source when the person presenting the news was visually appealing. The author cited an example of the importance of looks in television of a woman who was fired from her job as a news anchor because of her appearance. Additionally, the passage discussed how the television news cycle downplays each story since each program has a limited amount of air time, so they try to fit in as much news as possible. This affects the way in which the news reaches people since it allows them less time to take in each story before the news anchors present a new topic.

Because television networks only have a limited time slot in which they show the news, they must cram as much information as possible into this short period of time. This forces the reporter to leave out facts due to timing, whereas newspapers do not have this issue. Additionally, the news broadcasted on television jumps from story to story with no segue, giving viewers no time to think more about the story they just heard. The author also emphasizes how important the appearance of a television newscaster is, as people trust news from more attractive people. The author provides an example of this by telling the story about a newscaster who was fired from her job because of her appearance.

- The barn owl relies on horizontal and vertical dimensions to capture prey. 
- The barn owl and humans have the same azimuth, but humans are 3x worse at vertical dimensions. 
- The barn owl is very sensitive to subtle changes in its prey. This can be shown through the realignment of the talons. 
- The barn owl's face is the most striking feature. 
- The feathers on the owl's face are significant to the owl's hearing. They act as outer ear canals for the owl by funneling in sound. 
- The barn owl uses differences in timing between its right and left ears to determine how far the prey is.

He consulted the National Zoo in DC on their new panda exhibit in 2006. 
- Dr. Wang acknowledges critics when they say that the focus on pandas in zoos takes away from the real culprits of panda endangerment. That is why the National Zoo now has decision stations for visitors to look at. These are Dr. Wang's favorite part of the exhibit since they help visitors understand why the panda problem cannot only be solved by biologists. 
- Pandas represent yin and yang in Chinese culture. To Dr. Wang, they represent a balance between research on pandas and wildlife conservation. 
- Research on pandas may take away from research on other endangered species, such as snow leopards. But panda research can also help create wildlife corridors, which have been compared to rivers.

He would be known to put the band's needs over his own, so he still felt content with not having too many solos during the band's run. Even in recording sessions, Berry didn't have much time to shine due to the restraints of the era. However, even though swing music wasn't really considered music worthy of dedicated study, there were big moments that Berry eventually came to embody where the light of his music would shine through, such as one song in 1940 where he was featured from beginning to end. Although sidemen were considered the traveling salesmen in relation to their supporting roles with the band at large, ""selling"" someone else's music in the best possible manner, they stil l",c,a,c,d,c,d,a,a,,,Thu May 26 2022 15:47:21 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),7,6.125,378,Sun May 29 2022 17:03:54 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),16,0.23880597014925373,0.4564221676745386,Sun May 29 2022 16:58:51 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),299,"This passage dealt with the career of Berry as a sideman. Some of the main points discussed in the passage included Berry's personality of being content with the priorities of the band rather than getting his own wants out there. This caused him to not get much attention through solos, even though solo pieces during this time were fairly short due to recording constraints. Another point dealt with the fact that sidemen were like the door-to-door salesman of the time and that their job was to ""sell"" other people's work as best as they could. The concept of swing music itself was also deemed as being for dancing and clubs, not for study. Even with these preconceived notions about what Berry could do, there were moments in his career when he would get the chance to play some of the most intricate music through solos during the 1940s.

The passage introduced us to the fact that many of us will not recognize his musical work due to the fact that he had an easygoing personality and put others in the spotlight before him. The passage described that, even though the swing music that Berry would play had a reputation of being simple, superficial dancing music, he would go on to finally engage in his own solos and features where his music would be described as being incredibly intricate and beautiful. The general description of being a sideman was described as being like a traveling salesman, often ""selling"" someone else's work as best as they can. Their lives were difficult for musicians, but the positive achievements of Berry's career made some parts of swing worth it.",c,a,c,d,c,d,a,a,,,Thu Jun 02 2022 15:38:59 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),7,6.125,157,H2,Thu May 26 2022 16:18:22 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),Thu May 26 2022 16:09:28 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),H2,Sun May 29 2022 17:24:40 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),,H2,Thu Jun 02 2022 15:55:58 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),Thu Jun 02 2022 15:49:16 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),"Although Passage 2's format allowed for a more dynamic and novel method of thinking, the giant sprawl of information and constant backtracking between connecting points made the information feel more suited for a dedicated presentation for more dire subject matters. With the purpose of just getting information across for a comprehension quiz, Passage 1's more compact and straightforward method allowed for me to read through and pick up on important points more quickly.,As stated in Question 1, both methods from the two passages can be beneficial for learning, but for different purposes. If I was faced with the need to process a topic or issue that required serious discussion or more intricate thought processes, Passage 2's branching, connected points and ideas would help me to gather the big picture. It would also give me an easier time to dissect the passage into different chunks of information, with each providing differing messages or perspectives. For Passage 1, this method would help my learning if I was striving to learn a more straightforward issue or something that required a quick way to retain information, such as a comprehension quiz.","I believe that Passage 1 was easier to read because the passage's contents itself benefitted from the chunk-by-chunk format that allowed me to steadily comprehend each point. Although Passage 2 was a lot more interesting in its presentation, my immediate retaining of thoughts from both passages benefitted more from Passage 1.,Given that a few days have gone by from my initial reading, I think that Passage 2 has actually helped me remember more of its content. In the beginning, I would say that I definitely retained most of Passage 2's information, but Passage 1 was still quicker to come to mind. However, the dynamic bubble presentation from 2 made me remember each big bubble point similar to how I would remember a picture. When summarizing, the main ideas flowed a bit more naturally when I thought of how sprawled and distinct each idea was. Passage 1 was easier to read since everything was close together and straightforward, but after a few days, my memory of it may have mixed up sentences and ideas within each other.","Passage 1 was easier to read simply because of the more linear and compressed information. I believe that, even though Passage 2 may have helped me understand it better, there were several more instances where I would have to take a longer time to know what I was reading. This would include times where I would have to backtrack across bubbles to locate the part of the passage I needed or times where I would get confused on which order I needed to read.,I believe that Passage 2 helped me retain the information easier. The kinetic nature of the passage's format made me spend a long time reading and processing its messages, which helped it settle in my mind. Some parts of the format were a little confusing to navigate, but the extra time and effort that was warranted for me to understand it made my retaining of the passage's knowledge much better overall."

As for passage 2, the flow chart format made it easy to read the story by parts. The links between different parts were clearly explained and appreciated. Yet, it was still hard to go back and locate information because the paragraphs came in chunks.

I think passage 2 is a bit tricky. It helps me understand the flow of the story but I think literary academic learning is more than that. For instance, the tone and effect of specific phrases cannot be reflected by the flow chart. For literary texts, it may be more helpful to provide the original text, side annotations, and a separate plot chart. Also, the flow chart breaks the original format of a story, which may change the way students understand the passage. ","So far, from my personal experience, I recall passage 2 better because I have to spend some time with passage 2 to understand it.

Aunt Viv was someone that the narrator enjoyed spending time with because her house was calm. At this funeral, the narrator sees Reena and begins to recall their adolescence together. Reena's confidence at the funeral reminds the narrator of how she was in her adolescence. The narrator recalls that on her 12th birthday, Reena decided to change her name from her given name (Doreen) to Reena. After this, Reena refused to answer to ""Doreen"" and reinforced her new name by staring at people until they said her chosen name and pointing threateningly at them. The narrator also describes how in adolescence, it seemed like Reena was far ahead of her developmentally. Instead of having to navigate the ""rough edges"" of adolescence, Reena seemed to have jumped straight into adulthood. She was worldly and would discuss issues like Hitler's invasion of Poland, the Civil War in Spain, and lynchings in the South, which contrasted with the narrator's childish interests.

The argument is that people do not always need these interactions if it means sending efficient messages to people. While human interactions are left out, people are able to communicate so much easier and are able to get very close to each other via the phone. The passage also discusses efficiency in comparison to the past where people had to use letters and mail to deliver messages that would take many days to deliver.

The strength in the bite comes from the kinetic potential of the jaw, much like an archer pulling a stringed bow backwards before releasing an arrow. The ants also use the jaws to perform two defensive maneuvers. These are the escape jump, where ants use their jaws to propel them away from predators and use their new vantage point to re-launch their own attackers, or the bounder jump, which allows them to forcibly expel attacking ants from their nest, while shooting the trap-jaw ant itself in the opposite direction, out of reach of predators.

The jaw snaps shut quickly, but decelerates before the jaws snap shut completely. The ants also have 2 interesting defensive maneuvers: the escape jump and the bounder jump. The escape jump allows the ant to propel itself into the air, giving them a new vantage point from which they can re-launch an attack.

It is not until her own son, who had always wanted her to visit her in Miami, sent her a ticket to see a Russian dancer did Isabel reclaimed her passion in dancing. The legendary dancer used to dance modern and gave Isabel a new understanding of ballet. In the later half of her life, Isabel reclaimed her love and passion for ballet, and started dancing again.

Not every single piece of information has to be put into its own level and mapped out. Passage one provides sufficient context in assisting understanding of a relatively complicated and new topic which is what is helpful in my academic learning. Passage one divided every single piece of information into its own bracket and I, as a learner, is to caught up in putting them into comprehensible sentence, which distracted me from the actual information processing at hand. ","The first passage provides a good balance of structure and context, which really aids recall and comprehension in academic learning. The second passage on the other hand, as I mentioned in the earlier question, was very busy and redundant in its structure, that distracts the reader from the content of learning. I find it hard to recall details because I simply didn't have enough time to brush through the convoluted structure. ","I think the first knowledge representation is more helpful for academic learning because as I stated earlier, it is clear but also concise in the structuring. The context aids recall while the structure guides logical encoding. In comparison, the second knowledge structure is too complicated and distracts readers from actually encoding the information needed to be learned. "

The second passage alludes to certain ideas with organizing the passage into different categories via the title of the bubble or the flow chart. Furthermore, passage 1 was a little overwhelming with the plethora of words but the lack of substance behind them. ,It was hard to interpret the abstractness of passage one. Passage one was ultimately too sparse and tried to make reading it too easy. As a result of these attempts, passage one ultimately failed to make the text easier and actually complicated it further by creating gaps in information.","Passage 1 was too abstract. It consisted of many lone words that were held together by a flow chart; as a result, crucial and important details were lost in the process of trying to make it an easy read. By doing so, the passage that was supposed to be theoretically easier to read became harder to comprehend because of the knowledge gaps. Perhaps an integration of passage 1 and 2 would be ideal where there are short pieces of text accompanied by this flow chart idea.,Passage 2 was more helpful for academic learning because it organized the paragraphs by the main idea to provide a framework of organization while also providing the reader the chance to read more if they so choose to. I believe passage 2 was beneficial because it removed the anxiety-inducing effect created by a large body of text while simultaneously making it a more ""digestible"" read separated into shorter segments. ","Passage 2 did not omit nearly as much knowledge and therefore did not lead to nearly as many knowledge deficiencies or gaps. Passage 1 was ultimately too abstract with fewer concrete strings of thought. Passage 1 ultimately fell short of passage 2 because it couldn't make up for this shortcoming.,Passage 2 is more helpful for my learning because it limits the initial stress and anxiety that is associated with a large piece of text while simultaneously organizing the text according to the paragraph's main ideas.

However, having so many hyperlinks made the information hard to keep track of. I found myself wasting more time looking for specific information. When answering the question for passage 2, I was able to scan the whole map, locate details for all the questions, and come back to each section when it was applicable. This meant that I skipped over more information in paragraph 2, and did not grasp the information as thoroughly.","I remember far more details about the first passage. This is not simply because it was easier to read, but it forced me to follow a more detailed flow of information in order to answer the question. It is just like going through a maze. You may find the correct path immediately, or you will have to run into several dead ends first. Although the dead ends do not directly get you the answer, it narrows your search for alternative roughts. I had to take the wrong path several times before I was able to find the answer and in turn I was able to learn much more information. I am also someone who highly benefits from intricate mind-maps because my thoughts tend to get confused in my head. I like having everything separated for me.","Personally, I tend to easily mix up information when it is presented in a larger paragraph. I will misinterpret information and make mistakes on questions that could have been easily prevented. In a passage like #1, I was easily able to mentally compartmentalize each piece of information. I would not confuse the Mother and Father's role in Reena's life, for example. I almost messed up several questions in passage 2 because I misread what graphs were good and which were bad for a certain purpose. When everything is written to emulate the way we think about the information it is easier to understand. Although there were far more buttons and pages to keep track of, I was still able to comprehend it more easily. This also may have a lot to do with my familiarity with the subjects. I do not know much about managerial decision making so it was harder to remember. "

The mind-map itself felt like a visual representation of the inner workings of my brain. I did not have to spend any time mapping all the information myself. For example, I was able to easily separate the roles each parent played in the protagonist's life because the information was kept separate. Passage 2, on the other hand, was much easier to navigate. Thanks to the headers in each bubble, I was able to find the passage that contained the information I needed very easily. I like to create mind-maps like this when I am studying for a test. However, there were some times when I mixed up small details in the paragraph such as similar words or lists. If I had not gone back to check my work I would have missed a careless mistake. In short, I prefer passage 1 but find passage 2 to be a very good, more efficient, alternative.","As I explained in the previous question, I found passage 1 to be much more efficient. Although there were far more buttons I had to push and navigate in order to get the answer, I still found the passage much easier to understand. Infact, having to work harder and remember where all the information was helped me remember the information more. When I was looking for the answer to one question, I would collect details along the way. When I saw another question that refers to the information I had previously seen, I needed to use active recall to find it again. Again, this also can be attributed to the way that I personally work best. I can see why paragraph 1 can be very disorienting or confusing for some people. All the mind maps are hard to keep track of.","Although my scores on the written response were fairly low, I can say pretty confidently that I still have a pretty good grasp of paragraph 1. I remember all the side characters and what their relationships were to the narrator. On the other hand, I do not remember any big-picture takeaways from the second passage. This reminds me of the way I feel when I try to use a textbook when studying for a test. I cannot remember small details when reading large chunks of text. It is when I take the time to create a mind-map similar to passage 1 that I feel prepared to recall the material.  "

Matters like evolution of animals are discussed and taught to children from a young age, so people are able to reason with this type of content more, whereas statistics tends to be taught at higher levels of education, so audiences are less familiar with this content. Second, passage #2 used much less words, which made the passage seem less overwhelming and made it easier to navigate, especially when skimming over and trying to find specific sections after reading once. Because the first passage had much longer blocks of text, it was more difficult to remember which piece of information came from which text block.","Passage 2 was easier to go through because the way it was mapped out allowed the reader to create connections between all of the pieces of information more easily and keep it organized in the reader's mind. It was also helpful to take in smaller chunks of information at once, whereas Passage 1 consisted of large paragraphs that made all of the information mesh together in the reader's mind if they only read it once. The content of Passage 2 was also easier to understand; animal evolution is taught to youth from a young age, whereas the statistical analyses content from Passage 1 is content that less people are familiar with and have iterated to them less throughout life, so this made Passage 1 more difficult to follow as well as intimidating while reading.

These escape jumps have also been compared to ""popping popcorn"" because of the quick sting they give off to anyone near them that makes it difficult for the ant to be captured.

Therefore, the design of the second passage is more effective because of how it breaks apart the information into much smaller sections. It was also helpful to have the first page of the second passage that, to some extent, served as 7 different headers for the reader to direct themselves back to and that were more clear in the content they contained than the headers in the first passage. All of the headers in the first passage had a multitude of topics they each seemed to touch on, but the ""headers"" in the second passage were more specific. Being able to click on each of these ""headers"" individually in the second passage somehow made it easier to navigate than the headers of the first passage, yet I am not entirely certain why. ","Both of these passages had two vary drastic representations of flow charts, and a flow chart these is in-between the designs of Passage 1 and Passage 2 would be ideal. As previously stated, Passage 1 was very information packed with longer paragraphs. Passage 2 had the information divided up more which made it easier for the reader to digest, yet since it was broken down into such few words in every place this also made it difficult to follow and form complete sentences in the reader's head. Dividing the information into multiple pages in Passage 2 also made it easier to separate topics in the reader's mind, yet Passage 1 had the advantage of having all of the information laid out in one place for the reader to quickly sift through and reference back towards. ","I think a combination of both formats would be most effective. Passage 1 was almost too text heavy with long paragraphs that could have been separated a bit more to help the reader mentally categorize all of the information a bit more. As previously stated, Passage 2 broke up the information a bit too much and sometimes made it difficult to follow through a full sentence or point when navigating the article. Passage 2 still helped to serve the purpose of an information web, or flow chart, because the reader was able to see how all of this information connected to one another, whereas reading Passage 1 felt like reading a textbook with paragraphs that were just scattered rather than in a uniform format.

Some features include a panda grotto and a cooling rock.

Concentrating too much funds on captive panda breeding would be somewhat wasteful as it wouldn't conquer the true roots of the issue; real-world habitat destruction. It may be beneficial to allocate funding toward habitat protection.

Wildlife corridors are a method of habitat conservation that serve to bridge little patches of still-existing habitats, which encourages habitat revitalization and a potential boost in animal population.

There were several correlations of the new panda exhibit to Dr. Wan's previous research.

Dr. Wan spent a lot of time with a mother panda, and was excited when the panda left him the responsibility of caring for her cub.

If you are trying to make sense of a sentence while reading, most of your focus goes to that: making sense of it, while not really focusing on trying to understand the sentence or retaining any of it.

The rejection made her horribly sad, and muddied her idea of ballet, removed the beauty from the experience she had with ehr class. Later in life her son, Alejandro, who wsished his mother would visit, realized that inviting her to a ballet--one that could not be seen in Cuba--would make Miami enticing. His mother agreed to come, and the experience showed her again the beauty and impact of Ballet ",d,d,c,d,a,d,a,d,a,b,Thu Feb 24 2022 15:47:13 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time),8,0.8,635,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,K2,Thu Feb 24 2022 16:06:30 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time),Thu Feb 24 2022 16:03:50 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time),,,,,,,"For different reasons, each passage proved difficult to read.

Additionally, the passage talked about one exhibition in China where they had so many visitors, the exhibition had to be expanded as well as its visiting hours. 

Some critics had argued that people should not donate money to the exhibitions because that does not have a direct impact of the conservation of pandas. Instead, they urged that people should donate to other causes that directly prevent panda extinction.

The lack of journalism in news reporting is also apparent by the emphasis placed on the physical appearance of the person presenting the news.

This requires the audience to stop whatever thought process they had begun regarding the previous story, and shift their entire attention toward this new one. Secondly, newscasters have begun to value their appearance above all else, because they know that the viewers are keen to have a good looking reporter, over one that may be far more capable at completing the requirements of the job.

Essentially, the main argument of the passage was that TV news is not necessarily designed to inform the viewer, but rather entertain them. The author gave multiple examples of this, from the ""Now...this"" format that is commonly used to transition topics entirely, to the concept of ""talking hairdos"", or newscasters that were chosen simply for their appearance. The passage then went on to provide more detail about ""talking hairdos"" and explain that the viewer will go as far as to find news more credible if it comes from a ""credible looking"" source. A specific example was given of this being applied in real life as well.

I think that this is because for me, it is easier to read a larger section of information uninterrupted, and then make connections to the following information. The arrows with labels helped make these connections. In passage 2, however, the information was presented in very short, often less than one sentence blocks. This forced me to attempt to make connections between the different pieces of information as I read them. While this format was also an easy way to absorb information, I found passage 1 to be easier due to the larger blocks of information and less frequent connections between the multiple sections. ",,

The passage begins with the narrator walking into the funeral of Reena's aunt Vi. While Aunt Vi was Reena's biological aunt, the narrator also had a very close relationship with her and called her aunt as well. Seeing Reena at the funeral reminded the narrator about many aspects of Reena's personality, personal life, appearance, and family. She claimed that even from a young age, Reena had been very adult like. She even went as far as to call her ""an adult masquerading as a child"". She discussed this in further detail and addressed many other aspects of Reena's life. These details include Reena's relationship with her family.

","I think the way that the first passage was broken into little chunks made it much easier to follow the information. when i was reading the second passage, i often got lost in the big paragraphs of information, but the format of the first passage made it easy to follow along, retain multiple ideas (because one concept branched into numerous, comparable concepts), and even go backwards if I needed to. ","I think it was easier to follow along because the passage was broken up into little pieces, and it was very easy to follow the train of thoughts. However, I think that my responses are a little biased because the content of the first passage was far more interesting to me, and I was more engaged with the material. That being said, the concept of breaking up a large passage into small pieces like in the first passage is something that I do personally to retain information better. When it is broken up, it is less daunting to approach the text, and it is easy to follow what the author is trying to convey.

Splitting it up made it easier to read through quickly instead of reading blocks of texts, where attention might waver partway through. It was harder to read tone because it was a lot more impersonal, but in terms of gathering information quickly it was superior.,Both are good for different purposes. The first is easier to read quickly, but the second is better for understanding a perspective. I would like the first format better for a passage that was just facts, and the second better for an argumentative essay where the author's voice is more important.","I think they're both good in different ways and for different reasons. The first is quicker to skim and read, while the second forced me to slow down and actually fully read it. I was able to get the necessary information out of both passages, just in different ways. In the first I just skimmed through looking for the keywords in the question, whereas in the second I read the whole thing and answered the questions afterwards.,They're good in different contexts. If I want to deeply read and understand something or am reading something with an argument, the second is better. It is much easier to slow down and really read it. It is also less impersonal and as such allows tone through. Meanwhile, the first passage allowed quick comprehension of facts and is good if I want the gist of something, like a historical figure's life, that doesn't need the author's tone to come through.","It was easier to actually focus and fully read and comprehend passage 2. The first passage was too easy to just click through looking for answers without actually fully reading and understanding everything in it. That may have also been my fault, I should have just read through the whole thing first and then done the questions, like I did with the second passage, but I didn't because it was something different. I don't think the first passage is bad, it just made it easier to skip around.,I still think passage 1 can be useful for a quick gathering of facts, although it is sometimes harder to get deeper meaning and tone from it. But personally I think I'd prefer the second because it's easier for me to immerse myself in and fully understand."

The second passage is great for information that needs a quick read-up on for extra information that does not necessarily need to be in-depth.

He was a very talented musician, but the logistical constraints of the swing era, the 1960s, stopped him in a lot of ways from reaching his complete potential. The passage also talked about the swing era itself and how it was more for dancing and was not a style of music that could be studied because of its nature. It also talked about Berry's large performance which was a rendition of a piece from the 1940s. He played the entire piece from beginning to end, and it had some different features such as rubato.

He was alive and played music during the swing era, which was harder to study and establish oneself in because it was more subjective and up to the performer about how they wanted to do things. The author compared performers to traveling sidemen because they traveled for opportunities to perform for gigs or to make money. The performer was a more laid back and relaxed person, which was why he did not necessarily gain as much recognition as he likely should have for his talents. The author also then talked about the performer's piece that he played that was primarily solo and played by him, which was different since he often did not have a solo opportunity. It was in spite of his director he played this, which was a momentous part of the performer's career.

In the passage, the author talked about Berry and how he was an extremely talented artist and musician, but due to the nature of his personality and partially the nature of swing music he never became extremely popular. The passage also talked about how swing music was harder to study, but it gave soloists and artists a chance to express themselves in a more subjective way, which was a part of Berry's barrier. The passage goes on to talk about a certain piece that Berry then played which was primarily played by him. It was a blues piece and one that featured his solos and mostly him playing. The author also talked about how people doing music or musical artists oftentimes had to go after opportunities and travel, which was the comparison to the sideman and gave the passage its title.

In Passage 1, I often got confused or forgot which subsection the information I was looking for was under. In Passage 2, that problem wasn't there because all the information was laid out in front of me to quickly skim through. Along with this, possibly the horizontal format of Passage 2 made it much easier to quickly skim than Passage 1, which is something I personally find to be very helpful for my own academic learning. ","The horizontal style of passage 2 made it easier to read and remember,Both are good, the idea of a flow chart style for learning is helpful for me because I feel like it almost primes my brain to add layers onto one another to keep learning about one concept as I keep reading about it rather than just reading one long passage about the topic.","The format was easier to follow and a little more direct,They both presented information in a way that I feel like I improved my learning and understanding"

Comparatively, the connecting word in Passage 1 is further away from the key words making it more difficult to process as well. ","The flow of information was slightly difficult to follow, and the connecting words were difficult to follow as well. But, with the connection of certain concepts and being able to follow the logical flow, I found that I remembered and processed the information more in depth. ,In order to process the context of the information and more details, paragraph form of information is easier to read and comprehend. This method also makes it easier for me to read over. I do think that if more time was provided, the second passage would be easier to look back at and read. ","The passage was easier to process in whole in comparison to Passage 1 because of its readability.

Another point described in the passage was that of defending nests against intruders; in such a scenario, the ant would strike the intruder (which would have to be around the same size as the ant) on its side with its jaw to make it land outside of the nest, the action of which would also make the ant jump outside the nest.

More generally, I feel that the format of Passage 1 may be best for retaining knowledge, due to its concise and simple structure, but I still feel that the structure of Passage 2 is more conducive to establishing or associating semantic meaning with the text, though again that may be due to personal experience of having read texts that are consecutively long (like the format of Passage 2).","The use of either knowledge representation format is situational and depends on the exact purpose I need: if I might need to remember historical/factual/objective information (such as from a psychology/biology textbook) for an upcoming assessment/presentation, then I think the format of Passage 1 is best.

I think this is because I was unfamiliar with the representation format of passage 1 which made the mapping get in the way of learning. If I were to practice passage 1 mapping more often I think it could be equally if not more so effective for learning and retention. However, familiarity with passage 2 mapping was most beneficial to my learning.  ","I think both representation formats have their merits, in that they are beneficial for either type of subject matter. My memory of fiction tends to be better than that of nonfiction which may have impacted this in some regards. However, I can see how representing in both ways can be effective. For passage 1, having to struggle with how to even read the chart forced me to slow down and truly comprehend the information before answering the questions. The more straightforward but larger text in passage 2 I see as slightly more accessible for students because it is familiar to them. ","Both passages have their merit, I think after seeing my scores I was not entirely surprised by the results in that I do have better free recall in regards to fictional stories but do better on nonfiction when there are prompted questions given. I see that both passages have had their advantages in terms of my memories of the readings. Since the prima ballerina had an emphasis on the chronological order of events made free recall easier, also because the format forced me to have to comprehend the nature of events. For the jaws that jump however it became easier to search and find specific words which indicated an answer. In this, there was less need to remember the information because it was more of find the fact and answer the question. I think both passages have benefits for learning in that they both encourage reflection on the content and the need to understand the representation formats. "

- The ""Now, this"" model of television, which primes viewers to consume another short, compressed piece of news, which is unrelated to the topic preceding it.

This was well-exhibited by the case of one female newscaster (Christine) who was fired after being hired at a news station, as viewers responded poorly to her appearance.

She auditioned for ballerina school and got rejected; she wept for weeks. As an adult, she went to many ballerina shows and watched them all with a mix of joy and tension. She was never able to relax in the theater, as she could not lean back, and was enthralled by the performance. Her son, Alejandro, wanted her to come to Miami (from Cuba, where she was staying), but she would never go saying she needed to stay at the hospital and it was too much of a hassle to make the trip. He lured her to Miami with a performance he knew she would never see in Cuba, the performance of an escaped dancer from the Soviet Union.

One allows them to perpendicularly, jump off of the ground with the force of their jaw and reach higher ground in order to escape their enemy.

For example, since I already read the questions before reading the passage, I knew that some of the links wouldn't be as applicable to what I'm looking for. There was less information to read through. However, I do think that it is nice to have all the information on one page to skim through, like passage 1 did. This way it's easier to look back on a paragraph/section I already read without having to click through the links to find the specific phrase.","I think that while passage 2 highlighted the important information required to answer the questions, the widespread format of information throughout the different links made it complicated to look back on other parts of information. I would have to remember exactly which link the information I want was in, in order to be efficient. The format was also sometimes distracting and I found myself looking back on what I had just read, more often than I did during passage 1. Since passage 1 was all formatted in one page in separate paragraphs, while more concentration may be required to answer the questions, it was easier to find the information efficiently. The paragraphs all had headers and not much prowling around was required to find the area of information relevant to the question. ","I think passage one was easier to read because it was much simpler to have all the information on one page and in small paragraphs where the reader can grasp the main ideas. While it seems like a lot of information, compared to the format for passage 2, to filter through while answering questions, the information was easier to retain in the long run. The format of keeping everything on the same page definitely prevented more distractions. "

Being able to sort through the information is more helpful for academic learning in order to absorb the information better.

As learning the main ideas and the details around the main points is more important for academic learning, both representation formats are helpful as I was able to retain that goal from both passages. I think it mainly depends on the learning types of individuals. For example, the format for passage 2 may be better for visual learners than passage 1. ","When trying to think back about the information while answering what I remember from the passage, I found myself having a hard time thinking about the words in the boxes for passage 2. I would only remember obscure words and have a hard time of piecing those words to the main idea of that link page in general. Therefore, I don't really have a good idea about what that whole page was about in general. However, for passage 1, I felt that I had a greater idea about what the paragraphs talked about and had more informational descriptions than insightful (passage 2). Even for the passage 2 multiple-choice questions, I still struggle to answer the question about what the passage discusses in relation to Dr. Wang's works and the zoo because the information is too vague to hone in on a specific answer.

The first one is easier/more intuitive if you need to quickly locate a certain concept, and the second passage is better if you need to find everything related to one group of concepts.","I prefer a type information format that's more similar to the first one. The second one might be more useful in certain circumstances, like if you're already very familiar with the concepts (for instance, if you already know what diagnostic tests entail, you could very quickly move to that box instead of navigating through the huge web), but overall the first one often splits up information in a way that is very manageable. ","I think passage 1 is easier if I'm trying to grasp something new, while 2 would be easier if I already know the material. This is because 1 is spread out and easy to follow, but kind of hard to individually process/recall, likely exactly because it is spread out in a long flow chart. 2 has information condensed densely, but the information is still based on associations. If I need to review error concepts, I can quickly go to the diagnostic tests section and get what I need immediately, because I already know what they are and how they related."

I believe this because the learner in this case is forced to process information in connective bits rather than lengthy, descriptive chunks. It is often times hard to learn through theoretically swallowing lots of information and is rather easier to take things step by step in order to remember relevant details. For example, when learning a song on an instrument, you practice the notes first and then run through the song. You don't run through the song and hope that each note is remembered or known prior to attempting them. Similarly, reading in chunks and hoping to remember the small details or connections within them is often hard to do because there are lots of words and descriptions within the sentences that may not always be remembered by the learner. Thus, I believe the formatting of passage 1 is more helpful for academic learning, including my own. ","Like I said, I believe that passage 2 was easier to read due to the fluidity of the words and passage 1 was easier to interpret, forging better academic learning. I believe this to be true because the information was divided into its most simplest form, where the reader actively had to put in work to interpret the connection between each word/idea/component of the story. As a result of having to put in this work to connect simple components of a sentence, the reader thus had to insert more effort into processing a single entity, which overall is more conducive to better memory of things and increased academic learning. ","I change my answer for this question based on seeing my scores. I believe that the formatting for passage 2 was more beneficial to my own academic learning because of the chunks of text that it included. The first passage was more divided up and spread out, so retaining quantity was much less likely than it is for the formatting of passage 2. Since the questions were shown with the text, I found myself not reading through every single small box in the story as I simply observed the answers to the questions and moved on. As for the formatting of passage 2, I had to read through every bit of information in order to learn more and find more answers to the questions. For that, I absorbed more information throughout the passage than I did with passage 1. "

Reena was really beautiful, but she had a strong personality. She obligated everyone to start calling her Reena when she was 12. She acted like an only child, even with so many siblings. She was overwhelming to everyone, as her father tried to avoid her while her mother was more strict with her. The narrator explains that Reena skipped adolescence time, as she started to read harder books from a young age as the narrator read easier books. One time that the narrator recalls is when Reena told her about the US/ Japan weapon trade and the narrator knew nothing about.

He primarily played tenor saxophone and although he was extremely capable, he hardly ever found himself to be in the spotlight. Much of his career he spent as either a member of a larger ensemble or as a Sideman. A sideman is a musician that utilizes their skills to further the careers of others and promote musical talent other than their own. Despite this life in the shadows, there were a few moments where he was able to show his expertise. One of which was during a showcase where he had a solo for less than a minute, but the technical excellence during the solo was mind-blowing. There were a few other instances where he had a solo to himself when he was part of the Calloway group which allow illustrated his abilites. In the end, his creativity was stilfed by the era he was in, either because it was difficult to record his own music or that the swing music he played was not as well recognized or well known.",b,b,c,a,c,d,a,a,,,Mon Aug 30 2021 17:55:50 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),6,0.75,458,Thu Sep 02 2021 13:15:19 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),16,0.23880597014925373,0.348611933239906,Thu Sep 02 2021 13:10:18 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),299,"""The Quiet Sideman"" is a passage that centralizes around the life and career of a saxophone artist, Mr. Berry. Berry's excellent abilities are not well known due to his lack of access to recording studios during his era and the lack of interest in the swing genre at that time. He spent most of the beginning of his career as a loner due to his genial  part of the Calloway group as a sideman. A sideman is a musician who typically only works to further the careers of those around them by working as background musicians, rather than for their own career goals. Sidemen are akin to traveling salesmen. Despite his lack of notoriety, Berry did have a few successful moments later in his career. This occurred when he was given the opportunity of preforming a solo during a concert, one time with the Calloway group and another time without them. Each of these solos only lasted about 30-45 seconds by the quality of his musicianship shone through.

The shorter phrases allowed easier manuvering throughout.,I think a combination of the two would be the best. Although the shorter phrases in passage two made the content easier to navigate, often it was more difficult to grasp understanding from each individual box/node. Perhaps having the formate of several pages and many smaller boxes/nodes but some more descriptive boxes lower on the hierarchy that contain a sentence or two of descriptive information.","I think the quiet sideman was easier to read beacuse the information was broken up first into groups based on the content and timeline and then into much smaller nodes that each had a small piece of information on each. However, sometime the nodes were too small of a chunk which made it difficult to grasp the bigger picture in some situations. ,The main reason I chose the Jaws that Jump was simply the amount of content I had to learn about. While the paragraphs were large and cumbersome at times, it still made it easier to understand the information I was expected to learn and retain it for a longer time. More of the smaller details stuck with me, whereas in the other passage I found much of the important details slip thorugh the cracks.",

While the first passage was easier to understand, it may have been due to the format matching the narrative style of text more effectively. The second format may be more efficient for less dense  descriptions since it is more spread out and separates based on ideas and concepts. ","Both passages were good for demonstrating the chronology and flow of the information. The biggest distinction was the amount of text and style of information, which was different for each representation. Overall, the first passage was the easiest to read but both representations helped to consolidate the information and make connections. ","Passage 1 was easier to follow and was helpful for recalling information initially. However after some time, it was harder to recall since the information from the passage was more densely packed. Passage 2 was initially more confusing and felt somewhat choppy to read through since the pages were more spread out and in incomplete sentences. However it was easier to recall later since it was more spread apart."

I think this makes the representation better for the attention span. 

The first representation was harder to follow because a single sentence would be scattered across an entire graph, which forced me to spend more time just parsing the sentences and making sense of them, thus reducing the efficiency. There is advantage to this representation though, that lies in that it could display connections between nodes in the information network more clearly, for instance if the same person occurs multiple time throughout, the reader can follow the connections around that node with the person to more easily track the role of that person in the entire picture. This notion would work well with passages where a lot of references/reoccurring themes are present. Though, I do think that this advantage could also be achieved in the second representation by using marks such as highlights/underlines to emphasize repeating names or themes, etc; or by adding a side graph to it that only shows the relationship network between recurring items/themes. 

In general, I think the second representation is clearer and more efficient, although there is still space for improvement. ,Again, for reasons specified in the previous answer, being easier to read is definitely a first step to helping learning. 
I would find the second representation better than now though, if it could provide more information about logical connections, aside from the big-picture structure of the network. I think showing the connections would help more with memory. While the first representation managed to show some of these helpful logical connections, they were kind of drowned out in the sheer number of nodes and graphs. ","Other than the reasons specifies in my response in the last session, I find myself remembering much less and much less clearly for passage 1, partly because the format of scatted nodes and graphs hindered my ability to read and integrate the information. It took longer just to decode the multitude of joints, which is difficult for people accustomed to reading in structured sentences, and I was unable to comprehend of the information properly, such as which music pieces were made by who and important for what. ,(aside from the reasons specified in the previous sessions' response) Apparently, I remember more from the second passage. This partly takes over from my experiences in research paper reading and GRE, SAT etc, where information acquiring is easier for me when reading entire passages. Honestly, the experience might get better for someone more used to reading in the logical graph format like passage 1, but that is not me.

The first map was a little simpler to read, but the chunks were longer and more similar to reading an actual passage rather than an abbreviated map; the second map was more abridged, had comprehension questions at the top of each link page, and generally summarized information in such a way that it could be absorbed more quickly. While both were helpful for digesting information, I preferred the second passage because it transformed the content and made it more accessible. ","After having spent time away from the passages (3 day follow up), the abbreviated knowledge representation format in passage 2 was much easier to recall and sift through each main idea. While I had the added benefit of passage 1 being the first I read, it was harder to remember individual pieces of information, like dates, names, and facts, because they were embedded within a larger block of text. While both formats had links to big idea nodes that made it easier to summarize and memorize the passages, I preferred the organization of #2 because the links were smoother to navigate, divided themes up into clusters, and being able to zoom out and look at each theme in the main diagram helped me to connect ideas much more efficiently.","The second passage was the easiest to work through visually and condensed information into small but meaningful enough chunks so that ideas flowed naturally in the chart. This format made it easier to create a memory pathway in my mind that I could work backwards from. My initial score for passage two was a 4/9 but after reading the themes at the top of each link and memorizing key details, it was easy to understand the overall meaning of the passage. The first representation format is effective too, but it was harder to remember important takeaways within the larger walls of text, so I had to go back and reread sections a few times, which may have disrupted my chronological encoding of information. Overall, both representations used nodes well, but passage 2 was the easiest to get through."

When I sit down to read a passage, sometimes I reach the bottom of the page before I realize I didn't take the time to comprehend the words I just passed over. By using a knowledge representation format, the most important takeaways and facts are organized and emphasized, limiting the amount of mental summarization or note-taking that must take place to reinforce the content through restudying and re-reading it. ","Both representations are helpful to learning because they structure the content and use nodes to highlight main takeaways as well as linking verbs or phrases to connect the dots and chain information explicitly with a visual aid. While it was easier to remember information with format # 2, sometimes the way it constantly branched off made it confusing to read and harder to remember chronologically, although it made recall easier. On the other hand, format #1 was easier for initial learning and followed a sequence that made more intuitive sense. Both made summarization much more accessible and I would incorporate either technique into studying, but for different purposes: one for encoding and one for recall.","As shown by the test scores as well as the ease of recall after having spent a week away from the passages, representation #2 was the better performer. The quizzes tested my ability to pick apart key details, and the ""flowchart"" style of #2 made it easier to create mental images and sift through other nodes at will as opposed to format #1, which felt more like traditional reading. While #1 still divided content into meaningful strands, #2 felt more focused with links separated by theme. Because of its highly structured format and its lesser focus on grammar or filler words, diagram #2 is conducive to studying because it summarizes information succinctly and visually, making it much less taxing to commit to memory than #1.

First, the author points out that because of the limited attention span of viewers and structure of TV programming, news segments are broken down into small chunks that are not connected to each other, and that do not allow a careful explanation of the details of the story or the viewers to put any critical thought into digesting them. The author explains that TV news does not have merit in any useful journalist way, but has become another form of entertainment and does not hold any value beyond that. Additionally, the author explains how unreliable the news is, as the goal of TV news is to hire the most attractive people that appear the most ""credible"" at face value and therefore dictate what information viewers believe and what they do not trust. Finally, the author cites an example of a female newscaster who filed a lawsuit against a TV news station as she was fired based on her appearance. The author uses this example of this newscaster being fired because her appearance did not make her look ""credible"" enough to viewers to justify their claim that the truth is TV news is fabricated ",c,b,a,b,d,a,c,a,d,,Wed Mar 09 2022 09:25:49 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time),9,1,306,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,K2,Wed Mar 09 2022 09:29:34 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time),Wed Mar 09 2022 09:25:56 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time),,,,,,,I felt Passage 1 was more helpful for academic learning because it had the text broken up into more indiviual sections which allowed for short blocks of information to be easily accessible when asked to recall specific components of the text. ,,

Passage one did not elaborate on certain details and this made it hard to understand fully certain topics.

The reader is able to follow the lines to see how Isabel was thinking and what happens next for Isabel. Passage 2 was easy to read because it broke down Berry's musical career into smaller chunks. This is so the reader is able to look at big, intricate details and refine them into smaller, simpler details. ,Personally, the best knowledge representation format would be passage two because if I have a passage that has a lot of information, I would rather break it up into smaller details so I can understand and remember it better. ","I believe that both passages were easy to read. The first passage broke up big events into small summaries that allows the reader to gain important details from each event because of how short and concise each event was. Also, it was easy to follow because it showed how Isabel was influenced by each event and what it led to. The second passage was easy to read because it broke up big events into even smaller details that the reader is able to follow; although that there is more details to remember, the flow of the passage allowed the reader to absorb smaller details to fit a bigger picture. ,Personally, I believe passage two is more helpful in my academic learning because I believe that breaking up lots of information into small details can help me learn something about a certain passage and I am able to come up with more original thoughts, rather than taking blocks of information and just restating what has been said. ","I believe passage two was the easiest to read because it took a lot of huge information and mapped out each event, thought, or detail into very small and concise details that made it easier to understand, follow, and read. As a person who needs to understand the the little details before looking at the bigger picture, it was a lot easier for me to read. ,I believe passage two would help me the most in my academic learning because as I stated before, I like looking at the smaller details that make up the bigger picture. It helps me remember the main thing within a certain part of the passage by paying attention to small details. "

It mainly argued that the news as presented on T.V. has become merely a form of entertainment, where serious subjects are not treated with respect. The author embodies this with the commonly used T.V. phrase ""Now.. This"", which is used by television show hosts to introduce new topics rapidly, that have nothing to do with previous topics. This rapid changing of topics is due to limited air time, and causes viewers to not pay as much attention and deeply think about what was just presented. The author also talks about how many television news hosts are only picked for their perceived attractiveness and credibility. The author cites a case in which a lady sued the television network she worked for, as they fired her for not sustaining much viewership.

He believes that at its core, television news is meant to be entertainment, and that the hosts of the news shows are only chosen for their perceived attractiveness and charisma, and not their actual skills at storytelling and news presentation. If they can keep viewers, they can keep the job basically. This lead one woman to suing  the television network she worked for, believing they fired her for not fitting their standards for a female host. The author argues that this presentation of television news devalues the actual news, and takes away seriousness from serious matters. The author brings up the phrase ""Now.. this"" which is a common T.V. phrase used to quickly transition from one topic to the next. This quick transition of topics is done because airtime is a valuable commodity for the television networks.

The passage argues that due to the format and profit incentive of television, news as presented on T.V. has become watered down, and purely for entertainment. This sentiment is reflected in a common news saying ""Now... This"", which is a saying used to transition between unrelated topics. This quick changing from topic to topic, devalues each topic in specific, and makes it harder for the viewer to take the news seriously. What the viewer does take seriously, argues the author, is the perceived attractiveness and credibility of the reporter. Thus, T.V. networks try to chooses the most attractive well-spoken people to present the news, not those who could actually present the news in the most accurate and meaningful way. This led to a lawsuit in one case, where a woman sued the T.V. network she worked for, claiming they fired her for sexist reasons.

He was a shy person and his music was usually a solo or a sad music and in his time young generation was more inclined towards the pop music especially the music in the parties and bar. His music was neglected and got less attention or was rejected because of the nature of his music.

In the first passage because of more sections or branches I have to go through each section to find the appropriate answer. In contrast if I will look for answer from the passage 1, I do not have to go through the passages as it was the case in passage 2 but just the words given in the passage 1 were easy to go through and find the right option. If I will be given a little bit more time like 5 more minutes I could go through the format 1 much quicker and will rely on it more. So I will say both formats work well for me. 
Thank you!,I will choose both formats as both of them explain the material in their own way and were describable. ","I will prefer the 2nd passage over the 1st one. But if I will be asked to go through both passages and make a story or write a summary through them, I will choose both medium as both were quite explainable but I will prefer the 2nd passage over the first one because it has less selectable tabs to open. When I looked through the 1st passage I have to click all the options to find the answer which takes time but as I was going through that it made me used to of it. By the time I got the 2nd passage I was familiar with the format of the passage and was able to go through it easy but still it has less tabs to go through like a small tree and each tab was explaining more about the concept behind rather than just two of three words. So, for me the 2nd passage works best but I am ok with both passages as well. Thank you!,I will choose the passage 2 for the content description as it has more material in each tab which explain the story more as compare to the 1st passage. Thank you!","I prefer it because it explain more material in each box and there were less text boxes to go through as oppose to the first passage where I had to go through all the text boxes to find the answers. In the beginning I was not comfortable with the text format because I was not aware of the questions or format that I will be given a test like this and I will have to find the answers but I think if I will be given the same text or passages again I will be find to go through it fine. It just needed a little practice. ,I will choose the passage 2 as it has more explained material instead of just few words in each text box from the passage 1. "

The links, which were associated with an overall subtitle/subheading and the text helps readers encode more of the information because they know it is harder access to retrieve the information at a later date. This also goes to encourage more deeper processing of the information and to better understand what each section link was about.

With the first passage, I was able to recall most of the central information because it required less mental effort and activation, and therefore I think it was easier to read.,Although I think the second one was definitely helpful, I realized that I forgot a lot of the different elements and information given due to the constant changing of pages and links. This process diverted my attention away from the actual details on each page and focused more on getting from one page to another, which ultimately ruined my momentum and forced me to encode things slower. Therefore, looking back, I think passage one helped me better for my academic learning.","I think the knowledge representation that was easier to read is the first one, mainly because all the information was already present on the screen and I only had to scroll around to read it, not necessarily scroll through links and changing links in order to get the ideas. Therefore, the information was easier to recall and encode when I was looking at them multiple times while I scrolled between the prompts.,I believe both knowledge representation forms are helpful for my academic learning depending on how much time I had with each format and the depth I went to to process the information within. The first passage was much easier for short-term performance because I had to quickly recognize a good majority of the information without much time. If I were given more time, the interaction of the material and the active learning of the second passage definitely would have helped me in the long term. Therefore, I think both are helpful."

","Passage 2 was easier to read because I am more familiarized with reading information in paragraph form. The information also had a better flow and allowed for me to get a better sense of the big picture. As for Passage 1, it was overwhelming to see the words organized in that manner.

The Quiet Sideman was a reserved player who, in his early years, did not reach for the spotlight within the music environment. This could have been due to the playing restrictions of the swing era, where swing was not exactly considered an art to be studied and was often played in small amounts of time. Though the Quiet sideman received little recognition, he still managed to play beautiful pieces of work. In one of his pieces, he played for an entire song that lasted five whole minutes, which was quite unusual for his playing style. It was said that his sax playing echoed through the backround of the piece with somber like sound.

In the first representation format, All of the text was given on a single page and all the reader had to do to access any piece of information was simply scroll and zoom in and out. The information with the first representation format was evenly spread out and had a ease in which it flowed from one point to the next. The Second representation format also flowed with general ease; however, to access information, it required much more time navigating between pages to find the information that was needed to answer the questions.,I think representation format one allowed me to learn and retain more information than representation format two because of the way that the information was written. In representation format one, the information was given in paragraphs, which I feel allowed me to remember the information very well. In representation format two, the information was only given in a flow chart manor with small words of connection between each point. I feel that only having the small words of connection made the second representation format much harder to remember because the small connecting words were not as meaningful. Traditionally in school, Information is given in paragraph format, so I found this method of learning much more familiar than I did the second method. This familiarity coupled with the ease of retention and learning makes representation format one helpful towards my academic learning. ","Representation format one was much easier to read than Representation format two because the information was completely laid out Infront of me and I did not have to preform as much navigating. I also am much more familiar with representation format one, which is in traditional paragraph format, than I am with with representation format two, which had a much more flow chart like layout with much shorter readings. ,I found representation format one to be helpful for my learning due to its simplicity and familiar style. Passage one was much easier to navigate than passage two and I felt that I spent more time looking at the material than actually moving around the passage. The more time I was able to actually read the quicker I was able to memorize the material. I also liked that I could see the entire flow of the chart while having the material of main point under each header. This paragraph format made it much easier for me to make connections to the reading because it read like something from an actual text or documentation. The second representation format had only the key words in each linking box, and this made it difficult to really remember key facts because things were only connected by a few words and arrows rather than whole other sentences. ","I still think that knowledge representation format one was much easier to read than representation format two because it was in paragraph formation, which I find easier to navigate, and it allows for the information to more easily encoded. Reading the passages in paragraph formation was much more familiar to me and when reading the passage, it felt as if I was truly gathering and learning information, where in passage two I felt the information was spotty because it was given in such stringy formation. ,I think passage one is much more helpful for my academic learning due to the information being given in paragraph formation. When the information is given in paragraph form, the reader is truly hearing a story and it is meaningful, which is much more memorable than strings of information with little words in-between them. Although passage 2 was much easier to navigate, the information was unable to really stick in my head, and for that reason I feel representation format one is much better for my academic learning.

One specifically was mentioned as 'trying to catch hot popping popcorn' because the ants were so frantic in moving about that they're nearly impossible to catch. Another defensive action they had was the ability to knock predators out of the nest, protecting themselves from an attacker. One belief for the development of the action over time was generational advances, in a survival of the fittest kind of adaptation.

Two types of ant genus were mentioned, discussing the researchers who studied these mechanisms. It was mentioned that the jaws can close with speeds up to 120mph. The jaws then decelerate as they close, so there's no damage to the ant itself. There was mention of the defense mechanism for ants that allows them to hop away and gain a new vantage point to attack. The act of catching one of these ants during this process was related to trying to catch popping popcorn. The other defense strategy associated with the jaws was one that would knock the attacker away from the ant.

She recalled that when she went up the stairs, it was like walking up to heaven. During this first performance she could not sit back she was so enthralled with the ballerinas. This performance inspired her so much that she herself tried to become a ballerina, but she was unsucessfull. This lead her to be very sad at every ballet performance she would watch in the future. Later, she had a son named Alejandro and he would try to watch ballet with her in Maimi. She would alway turn him down becuase she said that Cuban ballet was better.

If one was not helpful for my academic learning, then I would likely get worse/different scores on the later tests. This would mean that both of these formats are helpful for academic learning.

He was very talented, and his most notable performance was a 1940 song where he played throughout the entirety of the song. The job of a sideman was hard, because there was little opportunity for solo performances. The music that the main character played was not used for everyday entertainment either, so it drew less attention. The article describes the struggles of a sideman's job, despite the extraordinary talent that the musician has.

","Looking at my performance on the questions for both formats, I think I might have performed better if I had been given a straightforward passage to read. Because the formatting of both the passages is unlike the usually texts that I am familiar with, it may have contributed to my lack of understanding. Because the later tests (the ones that I did not have the passage for) were generally the same result, I think my memory of the passage was based on my memory of the responses to the specific questions and not the passage and its formatting itself. ,I think that if I was more used to this format, I would be able to utilize it in a way that would promote my academic learning. I do think that the layout provided a lot of information that was grouped in a way that made sense to me. My written response score increases (slightly) over the course of 2 tests after the initial test, and this could have been due to the fact that there was a lot of information provided and I was able to remember more over time as the multiple choice questions from the previous session triggered my memory of certain ""links.""

I believe it made it easier and quicker to understand which direction the author was going into. However, I do feel like there was a lot going on that made it difficult to understand the flow of the passage at first. It was easier to read in the second passage, because there were less sub-topics, everything seem less-cluttered, it was easier to scroll through the passage, and the headings for each box was very clear and specific as well. ,I say both because although the first passage had a lot of aspects as it relates to the flow of the chart, I believe that after I get used to the flow chart and how it is structured, I'll be able to grasp onto the information much better and quicker. I did not understood passage 1 at first until the end, and then that is when I realize what ways I should go about it. When it comes to passage 2, it was very helpful for me to grasp, because all of the information were grouped together in one box and in their own category. To me, it was easier for me to understand given that there weren't a lot of boxes that I had to follow to try and find the answer to the questions. ","Passage 2 was easier to read because the text was grouped together according to its title and that made it easier to read and decipher the information compared to reading a concept map.,Passage 2 was written like a story, which made the information more interesting to read. I think that helped me to remember what I was reading, because everything was presented in a more organized flow. ","I believe that passage 2 was easier to read, because I was able to grasp onto the information better since the information was structured in a group format. Not only that, each box of information had a title that described the topic of each section. For me, I was easily able to follow along with the information and retain it better. ,I chose both, because despite passage 1 being more complex in its structure format, I still liked how it was quicker and efficient to follow. Passage 2 was helpful for my academic learning, because the format is one that I am familiar with, and I believe that my liking for organization helped draw me closer to it. "

The knowledge representation of passage 2 was divided into smaller paragraphs with clear titles. This was helpful in locating the paragraph I wanted. I would then scan read the paragraph for the information I wanted, this meant I may have read some information I did not want but I also did this in passage 1  as it took slightly longer to locate the area on the tree that I wanted.

The passage describes how having immense jaw strength leads to advantage in the wild

- Firstly, the jaws are the fastest in the world meaning attacking prey is easy for these ants. However, the ants never harm themselves as the speed decelerates quickly. The jaw is able to move so quickly due to a store up of energy in the ants muscles.

- Secondly, the sheer speed of the jaws gives the ants jumping skills. They can either jump from defense or attack. When an attacking ant enters the nest, the home ant attacks and flings the attacking ant in the opposite direction and sends itself in the other. The ant often lands in a position to be able to launch a new attack.  Sometimes the ant will simply jump to flee a situation by jumping away, this is a behaviour that may have originally been formed accidently.

However, the jaws can also be used for jumping abilities. The strength of the jaw means that the ants can jump to flee when they are being attacked (this may have been an initial behavorial accident) or when they are attacking another ant. When an attacking ant enters the nest, the ant flings the attacking ant out of the nest and it thus gets flinged in the opposite direction. This also means it lands in a position to launch a new attack.",a,a,d,d,b,c,d,a,c,,Fri Apr 08 2022 13:55:03 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),9,1,75,K2,Fri Apr 01 2022 18:31:07 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),Fri Apr 01 2022 18:22:11 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),Both,Mon Apr 04 2022 10:30:39 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),,Both,Fri Apr 08 2022 14:02:18 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),Fri Apr 08 2022 13:56:02 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),"As a psychology major, when I am preparing for examinations I find that I need to memorise lots of key terms and how certain terms exist in relation to other key terms. The knowledge representation of passage 1 is helpful in doing so. Furthermore, in academic learning I often have to learn lots of different systems and processes, steps, and certain causes and their effects, are important. The knowledge representation of passage 1 allows steps to be connected whilst also getting rid of unnecessary information. The knowledge representation of passage 2 is very helpful but if I was preparing for a test, it would have too much knowledge included that I would not need.","Upon reflection I would use both. I would use the knowledge representation for passage 1 for more scientific based subjects (psychology, mathematics etc) as I believe this is a helpful way to learn key terms, formulas, processes and their relationship to one another. I would use the knowledge representation for passage 2 for literature (or other humanities). This is because it is an effective way to summarise certain chapters, events or devices. I believe, in fact, that passage 1 should have used knowledge representation 2 and passage 2 should have used knowledge representation 1. This is because the story about the Ballet could have easily been divided up into key paragraphs with titles and the processes of the ants could have been summarised using key terms such as ""muscle- energy release"" whilst excluding unnecessary information.","Both. This is for the same reasons as stated prior. Knowledge representation 1 is helpful when are looking at connections, links and theories. Knowledge representation 2 is helpful when we want to know more descriptive information."

As well, in passage 2 the sentences are broken apart which is something that most people aren't used to. That is to say, because I am used to reading long paragraphs and analyzing them passage 1 was definitely easier to read. ,For me, passage 1 was easier to guide myself through without having to keep track of many factors that were involved in my learning process (e.g. going back to the main menu, remembering in what page a certain word was, or having to train myself to break off at sentences and still understand what is being said). I would say passage 2 is good for learning that is short and doesn't require much analyzing or memorizing, but passage 1 is better for longer learning. ","I still think passage 1 was easier to read and comprehend because it is a format that I am used to reading. It is normal for people who are in education to have to read long passages with titles that summarize or introduce what those paragraphs are about. It was easy to scroll through one page, and I felt that I could grasp more information at a time and form a mental map of what was on the passage. ,Passage 1 was faster and easier to read. Passage 2 made me have to remember in which exact page the information was and going back to the main page to see the ""table of contents"" always felt like a time waste. In contrast, in passage 1 everything was laid out in one page, and I didn't have to break off my sentences to follow through flow charts because the information was evenly divided into paragraphs.","I still think that passage 1 was easier to read because it felt more smoothly to me. I didn't have to break between lines, and I could quickly scroll to look back at a passage which I wanted to re-read. With passage 2, I felt like I had to take more time to answer my questions, and I wasn't really making connections between knowledge in my mind but rather just rehearsing information in order to encode—which I feel like it is a bad or inefficient way to learn. ,Although I may be biased because of my past experience, I feel like passage is definitely more helpful for my academic learning. It simply felt natural to me to read the long paragraphs and scroll through a whole concept map. If and only if the contents of a passage are very short, I would rather have passage 2, but for long passages that require me to make inferences and draw connections between the information presented I would much rather have passage 1.

Due to the success of this method, it was repeated, which caused a new mechanism of self-protection in future ants. The power of the jaw comes from energy stored in the mandible. However, the mandible will decelerate before closing, preventing the ant from being harmed.

The jaw of these ants is very powerful, with the strong force enabling them to bite through the thick shells of their prey. This jump mechanism not only pushes the ant out of danger, but can push a predator out of the ants nest, as well. When used for hunting, the ant can also propel themselves to a new vantage point, allowing a secondary attack.

This form of news is predominant on television due to the super small time interval that the news agencies get to broadcast their news",c,b,a,a,d,a,c,a,d,,Sat Mar 26 2022 10:40:56 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),8,0.8888888888888888,600,Tue Mar 29 2022 10:10:32 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),9,0.16071428571428573,0.36703409864956565,Tue Mar 29 2022 10:05:36 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),294,"In the passage ""How to Watch Television"", the author centralizes his argument to the shift in mode of conveyance of news from traditional newspapers to the television. He says that there has been many differences in modern news compared to before simply due to the television. Nowadays the news is super short and follows the now....then format where the previous news has no connection to the news that is about to be said. Also the newscaster's appearance has become of importance. People will tend to believe newscasters whose appearances are perfect and who look good to the eye, rather than focus on the actual truth of the news. To prove this, the author provided one example where a newscaster was fired based on her appearance. This shift to the television has degraded the quality of news according to the author.

The form of news portrayal on television follows the now ..... then format, where the next piece of news has no relation to the current piece of news and each piece receives a significantly less amount of time, i.e. around 8 seconds. The author really argues that this transition changes the way news has been broadcasted in a negative way because of the change in focus from the actual news to the newscaster's looks. This shift also makes the viewers believe a good looking newscaster more and this shift is supported by the fact that one such news reporter had been fired in the past based on her looks and her appeal to the audience.

Thus I find it easier for my learning.,"I definitely would prefer the first passage for academic learning because I feel like I learnt a lot more with the first passage than the second passage. Thruogh the first passage I could learn in detail about the topioc at hand however in the second passage I could only retain fragments of the actual argument. Both could be better depending on the purpose of learning. If it is just for information, then I would choose the first one, however if it for some exam or test then the second one might not be a bad option.","Previously, I had mentioned that the first passage was better for academic learning, however after seeing my scores in both passages, I am led to believe that both of the methods are perfect for this role because of my similar scores in both passages. I still believe that passage 1  is better in conveying more information and retention is easier in this case as well, but the second passage can be really well for multiple choice questions and just finding what you need easily, especially if you already know what you are looking for before hand. Overall, both methods can work just as well and they each have their own pros and cons."

The author points out that one of the main reasons of it is controversial is how difficult it is to convey emotional meaning or tone within words of a message. This makes messaging to people feel less alive but despite that, having text messaging gives a recollection of the events of conversing with someone and that can be special to look back to.

One of the key points that were indicated by the author was through a critique that mentioned how text messages did not express any feelings or tone which removed that extra sense of communicating with someone. Despite this criticism, the author does point out that text messaging has a history feature where anyone that has not deleted their messages can go back anytime to look back at past conversations, making these occurrences endless in a way. Having text messages not only is great for keeping a history of what you have talked about, but it is also quick and easy compared to conversations made in person.

While there are some great points of using text messaging such as its convenience of time, it has a drawback when it comes to expressing emotions or emitting tone through the messages. They lack what can be seen in-person communication as we look at a person's face to determine their mood and reactions to whatever they are listening to. Despite this negative, the author does point out the positives of text messaging as a medium of communication as it can be used as a way to go back to past messages like a memoir of events that occurred. It is significant enough to have conversations kept in storage so that someone can go back to that conversation and reminese ",d,a,b,d,d,d,d,d,c,b,Fri Jun 10 2022 11:44:50 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),7,0.7,192,H2,Fri Jun 03 2022 11:33:59 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),Fri Jun 03 2022 11:24:40 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),H2,Mon Jun 06 2022 12:07:49 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),,H2,Fri Jun 10 2022 12:07:27 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),Fri Jun 10 2022 11:52:44 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),"Out of the two passages, the structure that was most easiest to read and understand was passage 1. Passage 1 contained all the information that was required for a reader to know what the author’s message was in the passage such as texting being a global medium of communication but also being very controversial. Each box within passage 1 had a paragraph giving enough details of what it was based on its topic title above the box and by reading from left to right and top to bottom, I was also able to answer the questions since each box gave enough information to justify my answer choice. Passage 1s’ boxes’ branch accordingly to its topic title and the message it was conveying which helped me answer the questions. The structure reminded me of a more infographic type of style being presented for this passage. Each box gives a sweet spot between have a load of information and too little information to understand the message behind the box. 

Passage 2 on the other hand felt a bit harder for me to understand the author’s message to the reader as I was going through multiple boxes and seeing if there were any key words that I should take out of it. Each box only contained a single word and so it makes it difficult for me to maintain focus on what the passage was talking about as I am constantly looking at one box to another to get all the details of what this whole slide was talking about. There is a lot of visual clutter that prevented me to focus as I am constantly thinking maybe I am looking at the wrong path of boxes laid out to me to answer the questions. I did however liked the presentation as having links to divide the passage into sections helped me understand what topic I am on. Having a sentence or two in each box while reducing the number of boxes in this passage would make me understand it more I think. ","Passage 1 was easier to read because of how there was enough information packed in a single box to where I can understand what each box was talking about and their main points so that I can answer each question. Reading from left to right and top to bottom was much clear to understand and it fit the flow of reading as I had an idea where the beginning was and where the end was at. I did not get lost while trying to find where I needed to read next and that helped with me understanding what the passage was talking about. 

Passage 2 on the other hand seemed to branch out way too much with a couple of words on each box. Having to read every box and line just to get to the point of something takes too many visual disturbances as I have having to move my eye to locate the next box while figuring out if I was reading on the right path.  It took me multiple times to read each section of passage two when it was unnecessary as the number of boxes can be greatly reduced to explain the same exact information with a few sentences rather than a couple of words and having to look at more boxes to get more information. ","Even after attending three sessions, I do think the first passage had the easier format to read through as it presented its information all in a box. I was able to answer the questions without having to think about where I would think which box would help me answer the question. Reading from left to right and top to bottom was easy to see and navigate as I was able to know where to start and where to end. It makes reading and understanding what it is about much more significant when it comes to learning and being tested on what I learned.

The second passage had too many boxes that contained only a few words each and so it made it harder to process the information while reading it as I had to constantly move my eyes to the next box while also making sure that the next box, I read fluidly fits what I am reading about. While it does branch out and connects multiple boxes, it is hard at least for me to process that information as I am also looking at boxes at my periphery. Distractors are more noticeable when you use your periphery vision especially when you are moving your eyes. The vision distraction did make it take longer to understand and answer the questions overall.  "

There is also a negative side to how newscasters are chosen and it is not entirely based on their credibility with presenting news, but rather on how physically attractive they are.

Since news segments are divided into 90-second chunks, there is little time to process information into the brain that creates meaning and emphasis. By the time another story is presented, the previous news story quickly becomes something of the past making it less important now since at the moment, whatever is being said now is the main focus. There is also problems with the picks of broadcasters themselves since they are chosen not by their resume, but rather their physical attraction.

When it comes to delivering the news, each topic goes over a story for only 90 seconds, lacking the amount of time to fully digest and comprehend what the story is about as well as be able to build a connection to the story. There is also a lack of trust when it comes to the newscasters as they are seen as illegitimate to present news to the public as they are chosen based on their physical looks.

I think that the balance between the 2 structures would help my academic learning. Having the option to choose between these 2 structures can also be beneficial since structure 1 seems to provide a lot more detail and so I would think that would be more useful in a setting where you want to critically study and understanding what you are learning while in the structure of passage 2 can be used for quick sessions to review or something to learn something in short sessions.","While it did seem like I prefer passage 1 as it was easier to read, I can see passage 2 as an effective way to study and learn since it provides information quickly to some extent by reducing the number of words in each box. I can see passage 1's structure as more of a lesson/study session where a student can go more in detail learning about something while for passage 2, that can be for someone that needs a quick recap of what they learned on a certain topic. I think that if you add a sentence of two in passage 2's structure rather than a couple words in each box can make it a better way to access quick information as it can reduce the visual clutter and needing multiple boxes to give the point across. Combining both passage structures seems to be really beneficial as well for academic learning if that is another option too. But I can see how both structures can be helpful for in-depth learning as well as quick learning.","While my scores on the written response are super low, I can still see it benefitting when it comes to learning from both passage formats given how my multiple-choice scores are relatively okay. The first passage structure can be used on studying in-depth as it contains more information on each box like an infographic, just without the images. Someone can use these knowledge formats to take their time to learn and process that information with the details that it has with each box and how it is branched out. The second passage can be beneficial in learning for quick sessions or to use as a reminding boost to the information that has been learned previously. Since boxes contain less content compared to the first passage, that can be used to practice memorizing the information. I think making a sentence or two for each of the boxes in the second passage structure while reducing the number of boxes can make the whole reading and comprehension process easier for someone that wants to learn in quick sessions and for others that want to practice what they already know and such.

Lastly, both defense mechanisms allowed the ant to gain some distance from its opponent, the first allowed it to jump highly to gain a vantage point, and the second pushed itself and the aggressor out of the nest (The ants nest above ground)",a,a,d,d,a,c,d,a,c,,Mon Mar 28 2022 18:14:35 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),8,0.8888888888888888,99,Fri Apr 01 2022 18:12:41 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),16,0.18181818181818182,0.5605897001571377,Fri Apr 01 2022 18:08:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),280,"This passage gives an overview of the lock-jaw ant, its jaw capabilities, evolutionary implications, researcher observations, and defensive behaviors. The passage describes the mechanism of the jaw, how the ant uses the jaw to hunt by maintaining it open, and how the mandibles deaccelerate before meeting to avoid damage. Additionally, the passage refers to researcher's commentary on how it was to approach the ants, comparing them to popcorn popping all over the place. There is a quick description of how some of the ant's defensive capabilities could have come about, such as the jumping defensive launch, which is described to be most certainly a cause of accidental behavior. Lastly, the passage also mentions the ability of the lock jaw ant to defend its nest(which is above ground) unlike other ants, by hitting its aggressor and launching both the aggressor and ant out of the nest.

- The ants were able to close their jaws very quickly with a lot of force due to the release of energy from their mandibular muscles
- The ants did not suffer damage to their jaws because before they closed completely, they slowed
- Their were two particular jumps, one which propelled both the ant and the intruder out of the nest, and another which occurred when a predator/researcher approached that was essentially a frenzy of jumping and biting
- The escape jump (the one that propelled ant and intruder out of the nest) evolved via an accidental behavior that was selected for
- The ants were indigenous to South America
- The author compared the second jump to popcorn popping because of the bouncing ants that bit and stung like hot popcorn

Also, news is for pure entertainment rather than for credible information sharing, and that's why news anchors are judged so harshly on their appearance.

However, after a few minutes, it became a lot more convenient to read and find the answers to the questions presented. As for Passage 2, I also found it easy because it was similar to most of the normal passages I read through every now and then. In short, I think both representations formats are great, especially for Passage 1; if that specific type of representation format was more normalized in most passages, I believe a lot more people would opt for it as well.","I think both of the passages were easy to read. In general, I am more accustomed to the representation format in Passage 2 so it was a lot easier to read. As for Passage 1, it is not a representation format that I am used to so it took a little extra time to familiarize myself with; however, after doing so, reading the passage became a lot easier and it helped that the points written in Passage 1 were short, simple, yet informative.","Looking back at my scores, I scored higher in Passage 1's test compared to Passage 2. It seems that I am better at retaining information from Passage 1 and I do agree as it is easy to read. Besides that, the keywords from Passage 1 are easier to remember because it is represented in a very short and simple format. This made the questions simpler to answer as I do not have to go through several passages to find the answer. As for Passage 2, I still do think it is also easy to read because I am used information being presented in a similar format. However, it may have been harder to find the answers as compared to in Passage 1."

Passage 1's representation format would help me more in refreshing my memory and in terms of revision as it less condensed and uses short key terms to get information across to the reader.","I believe Passage 2 was helpful for my academic learning more so than Passage 1. Although I did not score any much higher than I did in the first passage (perhaps even lower), I still think presenting the information in a 'story-telling' essay format made it easier to understand.

In the long run, I believe I will remember more of Passage 2 than I ever will Passage 1. Either way, Passage 1 is ideal whenever I would like to revise the topic because the short and simple mind maps help refresh the knowledge I have learnt."

The jaws help the ants attack prey by snapping shut with great force, allowing the ants to puncture even hard shells. The force of these jaws comes from pent-up energy stores in their muscles, which is released when the jaws snap shut, though they decelerate before meeting to prevent injury to the ant. The jumping function, also propelled by the ants' jaw, may, according to some scientists who specialize in the study of this species, have evolved through accidental behavior such as banging the head to the ground. It helps the ants to jump around spastically, like popcorn, and position themselves to attack from another angle. Finally, the intruder-expelling function of jaws is triggered when the ants touch the inside of their jaws to their targets, causing the jaw-snapping reflex to come into play. The force of the jaw shutting is so strong that it sends the ant and the intruder it is biting hurtling off in opposite directions.",a,a,d,d,b,c,d,a,c,,Tue Jun 14 2022 15:17:04 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),9,1,83,H2,Tue Jun 07 2022 15:37:27 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),Tue Jun 07 2022 15:34:03 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),H2,Fri Jun 10 2022 15:19:13 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),,H2,Tue Jun 14 2022 15:19:14 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),Tue Jun 14 2022 15:17:36 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),"For the reasons listed in Question #1, I thought Passage 2's representation was more helpful for academic learning.

The first passage, while it was visually more interesting to look at, was hard to follow because the sentences that were formed from individual words were at times incoherent or were just too long to actually make sense. The structure of the information was still really helpful, but it was hard to understand some of it. Additionally, some of the branches of information in passage 1 were extremely large, which was overwhelming. The paragraphs in passage 2 were much easier to understand, as the paragraph had all the information you needed about a given topic. The sentences were complete, and it felt like information was easier to remember when I was reading it in the traditional reading method; the sentences were already made for me rather than me making my own sentences. ","Passage 2 was easier to read because it was done in a format that I am used to. I have frequently seen passages formatted in boxes with arrows with large amounts of text being inside the boxes. However, I have never seen a passage which had boxes that only had a few or single words in it. This caused it to be harder for me to read, as I had to get used to a new format, but also that I had to make my own pathway in reading the sentences, whereas in passage 2, the sentences were already phrased for me.","I am used to seeing passages in the format of Passage 2 (large bulk of text, such as articles, textbooks, and more!). Therefore, I didn't need to spend time to get used to a new format of passage. With Passage 1, it was hard for me to adjust to the new format that I have never really used before, and also reading some of the sentences was really challenging as the sentences that I formed from the flow chart seemed to be really long and at times impossible to follow and understand."

While I did find it helpful that passage 1 had directional arrows that went from a broad topic to narrower topics, as it made it easier to distinguish between the overall broad subject and the details about the subject, passage 2 had the same exact concept, so overall, I prefer passage 2 for my academic learning.","I found that the format of passage 2 a lot more helpful for my academic learning. In my classes right now, I find myself liking to read the content and then rewrite it in my own words. This easily allows me to take the direct content from a professor and relearn it in a way that allows me to understand it. However, it was extremely difficult to follow Passage 1's format because I wasn't used to it and sometimes the information was long and turned into run-on sentences.

The solos he did have were short due to that being the way the music he played at the time, swing music, was recorded.

It starts with a recount of how he started to play the tenor saxophone in college and joined a group there. The group was initially not that successful until he had joined and added new sounds to the music. It mentions his genial personality and how he tended to perform in groups rather than focusing on a solo career for himself at the start. The next thing the passage talks about is the music he had recorded with famous artists of the genre. In some of this music, he has solos that were revered though they were short. The solos weren't short from his own accord though it was just that the recording music at the time only had short solos for this genre. The last part of the passage talks about how it's hard to be a musician in swing music for a couple of reasons. The main reason highlighted was that swing music was considered music for get togethers or parties rather than for study, so the genre wasn't valued as much and the musicians wouldn't rise to as much fame/popularity as well.",c,b,c,d,c,d,a,a,,,Fri Sep 03 2021 19:12:48 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),9,8.125,68,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,H2,Tue Aug 31 2021 15:45:15 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),Tue Aug 31 2021 15:42:29 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),H2,Fri Sep 03 2021 19:18:05 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),Fri Sep 03 2021 19:13:13 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),,,,"I think passage 1 was easier to read since it was more like passages I had been used to reading before.,The connections between passage 2 made it so that the information was in smaller chunks and easier to remember where I had read it before.

Passage 2 had details that are independently understood, so it's easy to remember individual bits of information apart from other bits of information.","Passage two is easily digested in parts where each part contains a clear nugget of information that seems relatively more independent from other parts of the passage.

Passage 1 seemed to follow a linear flow that builds on previous information. Passage 2 seems to do that less so. Passage 2 is easy to visualize, the pictures are simple. Passage 1 constructs a whole world with sights and sounds. Passage 1 seems to require more attention than Passage 2."

This jump is powered by its mandibles, which store muscle energy that's suddenly released to snap the jaw. The jaw decelerates some as it closes, to help protect the ant from the force.

For stories, I find a linear prose-like reading experience to work better as it is visually simpler in prose format; I can scan blocks of text if I need to pick-and-choose certain bits of information.","Flowcharts seem to have worked somewhat well with Passage 2 in that it ""boxed in"" certain concepts which made them visually-decipherable. However, the flowchart was still somewhat challenging, compared to say, an outline format. Flowcharts show relationships, but sometimes I felt as if there was too much information presented between the flowchart and the large bits of text contained within each element of the flowchart.","If the flowchart were somehow (?) simplified so there's fewer text blocks and perhaps just  a few bullet points within the flowchart elements.

I like the visual representation of the concepts, but the idea is so novel to me it took a lot of extra ""meta thinking"" to understand the content and not focus on navigating the flowchart."

Passage 1 is different from the conventional type of reading we are used to, since it reveals next information by presenting flow chart in form of a link in the main passage, unlike Passage 2. In contrast the Passage 2, was more relatable with the questions I answered. The information flow in Passage 2, was in sequence (in compared with the Passage 1). The questions from the Passage 2, seemed easier than the Passage 1. 

I enjoyed reading both. Thank you very much for the opprotunity.","I like reading both the passages, the flow of the information was not like conventional passages as we are used to reading. The passages presented information in chuncks and using arrows to indicate the flow of information. But the passage 1 and 2 were different, 1st one was brief and had to click on links to find information, going back and forth a number of times caused me to take a lot of time to complete passage 1. The second passage was also presenting information like using arrows to indicate flow of information in sequence, but the sub headings of the passage, and unlike 1st passage the information was present in the main page. Which saved a lot of timing in answering the questions. But I think both the passages were interesting to me to read. ","Both the passage explained facts, I enjoyed reading them. The first passage was with links which took in different page from the main page, it took a lot of time to find the information I was looking for. But I enjoyed reading both passages with different orientations."

The Barn Owls auditory cortex has neurons that when each fire, give an exact place in space of where the sound is coming from. This precise hearing allows for Barn Owls to swoop down on their prey. This specific and exact hearing can be demonstrated through the Barn Owls extending their talons and rotating them to catch prey such as a mouse running away or one that's changing direction.

Barn Owls have are deadly hunters due to their ability to their change in direction of their talons, which they use to catch prey, such as mice. When a Barn Owl is bearing down on a prey, they can quickly change the orientation of their talons as a way to catch a moving or dodging prey.

This is very important for Barn Owls, as they are able to locate potential prey from the air. Barn Owls have individual neurons that when one is stimulated by an auditory noise, sends a signal to the Barn Owl indicating where exactly in space the sound came from. This is extremely helpful as Barn Owls hunt at night rather than the daytime. An example of how effective this hearing is for Barn Owls, when they are bearing down on a prey, say a mouse for example, they are able to realign their talons with a mouse that is running or moving side to side.

However, the first one requires less operations for finding any specific piece of information.
But if it's in a situation for no time limit reading, i prefer the second one, casue it's more structured and easy to review.,For academic learning, my own way of memorizing knowledge is to map a structure map of all chapters, pieces of information. Once u made the knowledge map like the second one did, it's easy to find any info that u want, cause it's all reasonable linked for u.

The first passage has the advantages: 
1. it's more strightforward when u want to search for any detailed information, while for the second passage i need to decide which part contain the information and then look it up. 
2. Based on the first adv, it's more aglined with the computer keyboard shotcut control+F, or command+F for searching the information.
3. The links within one paragraph in second passage sometimes have too big spatial distance, for formating all the info on the screen, so it might cause some extra effort to read based on the links.
The second passage has the advantages as followings:
1. i could imagine that writing up a structure of node and links like that, should be the best way for someone who wants to memorize the structure and details of the paper.
2. the logic was more clear.,For the important papers, i guess i would love to structure it in the format of passage 2. 
For the short time reading, passage 1 would be a better way to format a paper. I really hope the passages in my exam would be structured in the format of passage 1.","i personally prefer organzie the paper i read in the sturcture of paper 2, since it's earsier to memorize things during the process of figuring out the logic of paper.
However, for reading a novel passage, i'd like it to be arrange in the way that paper 1 does. Since it's spend less time for me to look for detail information without a lot of operations on the screen, and the passage 2 is more compliant with the keyboard shortcut search command.,Like i wrote in the previous answers, the process of arranging a paper into the format of passage 2 help us understand the logic of the paper, even the detail logic and structures. The logic and structure itself would facilitates the memory.
For my academic learning, understanding and memory is the key part, since i need to not only memorize those information, but also combine the other facts and knowledge to form my own hypothesis and thoughts."

The format serves well for the two different types of passages. The first passage being an introduction to lots of math/economic concepts, so the mapping structure helps me find key word and relationship between concepts more easily and clearly. The second passage is more of a science passage. There are more descriptions and less concepts or relations there. So the second one that have less ""mapping"" is also suitable for the knowledge it represents.","Previously, I thought Passage 1 was easier for me to read but after several days when I tried to recall the content of the passage, I learned better from the second passage. But it might due to the content of the passage. The content of the second passage are more approachable than the first one given that I do not have background knowledge for both passages. The first one contains many ""nodes"" and relations between those nodes. It is better for me when I have more time and can memorize all the nodes and the relationship. But given a short time, I could only learn and recall a small part of the nodes. When reading further nodes, I might forget about the previous nodes. For the second passage, although the structure is not as specific/well-defined as the first one, I can grasp the main idea and the general structure of the passage, instead of being overwhelmed by the details/relations within the passage. Therefore, both serve as a good format of learning but just for different situations. The first one is better for long-time learning and the second one is better for short-time.","Previously I think the first one would be easier to read since it has clear structure. But partly because of the difficulty of the content, I remembered less from the first part then the second part. The second passage, although with less structure or logical connections between concepts, the only structure proves to be very effective. I suppose in this case, too much structure or map-like representation might hinder understanding when I try to learn things in a short time. For a person who is completely unfamiliar with a topic, a more bottom-up (not sure about the term) structure like the second passage might be more helpful than the top-down structure like the first passage. The first passage might be better for people who have some prior knowledge in the topic and prepare to use them in academic context."

For the first point, the barn owl can detect minor changes in sound directions, which is evidenced by an experiment. The barn owl can change its direction to align with the mouse in dark.

Firstly, it is able to detect some changes in the directions of sound. It is evidenced by the experiment in which the barn owl can align its mouth the mouse in dark environment. The trough also helps in the process. The hair is transparent in collecting sound. When the barn owl hear sound from a small place, a part of neuron in its brain is stimulated.

I think it is pretty useful and important in my academic learning since in this way I could first get insights into the big picture and then fill each concept with the details. The clear relationships between concepts shown in a concise way are also crucial in academic learning.,"As for a long-time learning, the first passage provides a better mind map for me. As I mentioned in the last question, the first one provides a clear structure for every concepts involved in the topic; this is what I need for academic learning. Also, the kind of ""top-down"" (not sure I used the correct word) representation where I learn the larger concept and then dig into the details is very useful in academic area and researches. The second aims at a more general learning. I can quickly get the main ideas in the passage but as the content are less ""structured"" and ""bottom-up"" (by ""bottom-up"" I mean learning the details of the concepts first) I might not be able to learn much details or have a solid knowledge in the topic.","For academic learning in the area I have some prior knowledge, I would say the first one is more effective. I could quickly locate the concepts that I want to find and its relationship with other concepts. In academic studies or researches, it might be better for me to learn the new concepts and then find any details that I do not understand. The second one is easy to understand but if I would like to use this in academic context, for example in an exam, it would be harder to find a particular concepts. It also depends on the content that we want to represent. Scientific articles for general public and math material for more academic level should obviously be represented in different ways."

The style of Passage 2 left me with confusion surrounding the question about Reena's political discussion, (the one with answers involving Hitler, The Spanish Civil War, Weaponry etc.) and with confusion about the question of who is the narrator. The last time I took the quiz, I said they were an adolescent, this time, I said they were an adult. This is because I am uncertain of whether the narrator is an adolescent at the funeral, or if she is an adult at the time the story takes place. I believe she is reflecting on her experiences with Reena at the funeral, but even that I am unsure of.","My multiple choice test score was immediately perfect after reading through the passage. It was a lot easier to find the necessary information necessary to properly answer each question correctly. The choppiness of Passage 2 makes it a lot more difficult to piece information together, or just read in general. If given the option to read something for entertainment or to study, I would always pick the formatting of Passage 1."

Barn owls have round heads, and they are deadly hunters that can catch small prey like mice even in the complete darkness of night. Researchers first observed this behavior through noticing how barn owls' talons would shift to align with the position of mice even when they could not see the mice. Thus, more research was conducted on barn owls' hearing abilities. Barn owls are about as adept as humans at detecting the location of sound in azimuth (the horizontal plane); however, in elevation, barn owls are three times greater than humans. Barn owls' midbrains are also organized such that they can track the sound of their prey and stay focused on an individual creature's movements. Barn owls have nearly soundless flight.

He spent several years tracking pandas and interacting with them, even resulting in a giant panda mother temporarily leaving him with her cub because she had grown accustomed to his presence. He found this experience to bring great joy. Giant pandas also play a significant role in diplomacy and conservation efforts in China, thought to represent yin and yang. Wang believes that the focus on giant pandas has caused more people to be aware of necessary environmentalism efforts and also to learn about how complex the movement to conserve the environment is, requiring thought to economics in addition to biology. Some critics of Wang have argued that trying to help animals via zoos is useless because the main threat to these animals is habitat destruction. However, Wang believes that zoos provide necessary spaces for animals like pandas to grow and reproduce. The National Zoo in Washington, D.C., for example, has created its panda exhibit to reflect their natural environment. Recently, the zoo underwent several developments to expand the size of the panda enclosure and add new elements to it, such as Decision Zones in which visitors learn about the controversies and complexities behind panda conservation, as well as areas visitors can experience pand",c,c,a,b,c,b,a,c,,,Wed Mar 23 2022 16:43:30 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),8,1,712,Sat Mar 26 2022 16:12:47 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),22,0.55,0.6420096498007332,Sat Mar 26 2022 16:07:45 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),299,"Dr. Wang is a conservational biologist who has spent a great deal of time with great pandas. On one occasion, a panda mother grew so accustomed to having him around that she even left him with her cub for a while. He found this experience to be quite joyful. Great pandas are also very important in Chinese politics and conservation, representing yin and yang with their color pattern. Dr. Wang argues that public sentiment favoring great pandas has caused more interest in conservation efforts worldwide, and zoos across the world have begun to help great pandas breed. In particular, the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., which was formed in 2006, raised a great panda Bao Bao which brought many to visit the zoo. Furthermore, the great panda exhibit has grown since then and underwent a renovation which expanded its size. The exhibit mimics pandas' natural environment and also now includes resources for visitors, such as places in which they can experience panda habitats and Decision Stations where they can learn about the ethics and economic aspects of conservation -- learning about conservation efforts requiring work from more than just biologists. Critics of zoos and Dr. Wang's work have argued that the greatest threat to great pandas' survival is habitat destruction and that zoos do not address this loss by merely breeding the pandas; however, Dr. Wang argues that some zoos can still offer improvements to conservation efforts through creating public awareness and helping those animals survive.",d,c,a,b,c,b,a,c,,,Sat Mar 26 2022 16:15:36 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),7,0.875,167,Wed Mar 30 2022 16:49:22 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),17,0.425,0.6824188427639402,Wed Mar 30 2022 16:44:20 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),299,"Dr. Wang is a conservational biologist who has aided the conservation effort of great pandas both within China and the U.S. For many years, he followed pandas in the wild and observed their habitats, even resulting in a mother panda temporarily trusting him with her cub while she left for a moment -- an event which brought great joy to Dr. Wang. Several of Dr. Wang's contributions have been implemented in zoos to help conserve and breed pandas. Critics of Dr. Wang argue that the greatest threat to panda extinction is the destruction of their environments. While this is true, the passage appeared to focus more on the benefits of zoos and how it is still important for them to help breed pandas. Particularly, Dr. Wang points out that pandas like Bao Bao (who was brought to the National Zoo of Washington, DC) have garnered much public attention which has in turn caused people to be more focused and concerned about conservation. Within China, great pandas are a symbol of diplomacy and very important as they represent yin and yang and have aided the conservation effort. In the U.S. as well, the National Zoo has garnered much attention due to Bao Bao and other pandas that arrived afterwards. The zoo recently underwent a renovation which expanded the size of the panda habitat and allowed options for visitors to experience panda habitats.

I am not sure if this perception is accurate, but I felt as though Passage 1 had more dense content in it, and thus that I would need to study the material for a longer period of time in order to come away with an understanding I would be able to reproduce for someone else.","I am honestly a little confused because I had the impression that I understood Passage 2 better than Passage 1, and it is much easier for me to summarize what I read in Passage 2, but I felt much less comfortable with the multiple choice questions for Passage 2. I feel as though I understood Passage 2 again like a picture book, more like a story, in which I was able to understand the flow and structure of the passage better to reproduce a version of it through memory. However, in terms of remembering the specific details, I wonder if I actually retained more of Passage 1. I do feel as though this might have occurred because I did have to reread several aspects of Passage 1 and sift through the information. The higher amount of cognitive effort the passage required perhaps resulted in me learning the ""facts"" and ""answers"" better. For academic learning, I think sometimes both skills are useful in different ways. For impromptu speaking and speech-giving, Passage 2 would probably help me most, while for writing an essay or taking a memorization-based test, Passage 1 might be preferable for me.","I am surprised to see that my written response score for Passage 1 actually increased over time, while my written response score for Passage 2 decreased. I felt much more confident retelling the information within Passage 2, but I think what I felt confident in was understanding the cause and effect relationships rather than remembering specific facts and dates. From the number of possible points, it appears that there was overall more content in Passage 1 than Passage 2 which is what I mentioned in my response during the previous test, so I'm having a hard time interpreting my scores, as proportionally my score for Passage 2 was technically higher out of the total content available than the proportion correct for Passage 1. It does look like I retained more content overall in Passage 1, though. Also, I scored surprisingly well on the pretest for Passage 1, which I think made it easier for me to remember/guess my test answers later on and repeat them in my written responses. For passage 2, my score did improve a lot from the initial pretest. I think I would maintain that if I had to give an impromptu presentation or speech on a topic, I would prefer Passage 2, but if I had to take a memorization test, I would prefer Passage 1."

I still remember when I was reading passage one, there are different words and phrases passing from one section to several other different sections and each of the following sections also leads to other sections. Because of the relationships, and the small amount of information being provided in each part of the diagram, the overall passage seems not clear and I need to go back to find the clues and storylines.

But after some time, I realized that neither passages were helpful to understand the passage. For example, Passage 1 was very long and had too much details, at some point I was getting distracted and had to repeat the paragraph several times. By the same token, Passage 2 was super short and left too much room for imagination. Most of the answers were not present in the passage, or maybe they were for someone who is expert at music? But as a general reader, I felt that the passage was missing a lot of information. So my answer is Neither.  ,I have to admit that the first passage included a lot of information, which was helpful. But, I did not sense the cohesion in it. I was trying to understand, I did not understand it lightly. And as a recent Master's graduate, I read a LOT. Usually, it is very easy to read long papers and books. But in this case, it was kind of tiring. Same for the second passage, it was too short that I barely understood what it was about. Maybe, the most helpful format would be a balance between both passages. Not too short, not too long, and with cohesion. ",

The top node discusses the conservationist's contribution to a specific zoo. The zoo wanted to innovate the panda exhibit. Using the knowledge from the conservatonist as well as other researchers, a panda exhibit was designed similar to the original habitat of the panda, for the idea of introducing the pandas back to the wild. There is an ongoing issue of trying to keep animals in zoos rather than getting them ready to go back into the wild.

Personally, I liked passage 1 better as it felt like each node had more complete thoughts that could mean something on its own. Whenever I looked at passage 2 diagrams, it also felt a bit daunting to start at the top and continue reading until I got to the bottom node.","There were full sentences, which I found to be much easier as complete thoughts make ideas flow better in my mind, vs having to read a different node for every few letters. I also liked how passage 1 had 1 path to follow throughout in comparison to passage 2 which had multiple paths.",I still believe that the user interface of the first passage was much easier to read. It was easier on the eyes since more information was in a box rather than them being in very individual boxes.

HOWEVER, I also believe this was the easier of the two passages to understand content-wise, so that may confound my answer.,I think the first passage may be more helpful for my academic learning because I read a lot of textbooks and research papers that are lengthy. The second format seems like it would work better for shorter works and would not be able to adequately summarize, for example, a long textbook chapter. ","From what I remember, the second passage was easier for me to read about it broke down the information more than the first passage. I find myself losing my train of thought while reading paragraphs and sentences more easily than fewer words, so I thought that that passage was easier for me. ,I believe it depends on the information conveyed, but I believe that passage 2 helped my retention of information more than passage 1 potentially because of its format. I felt like I was able to write more about that passage because of a combination of prior knowledge about that passage and because of the format. ","The main reason why I think passage 2 was easier to read is because I have prior knowledge on that topic, it definitely showed with my test score and how I did much better on the test as compared to the first passage. I genuinely think because I have zero knowledge in anything related to music, passage 1 would have been more difficult for me to digest in the format of passage 1 or passage 2. ,I think that it depends on the kind of subject/topic that you're consuming. If you're consuming something more difficult, it may be more beneficial to have it broken down more like it was in passage 2. If it's something that requires paragraphs or that you already know a lot about, passage 1's format may be sufficient. I think that personally I would probably lean towards passage 1 in general because it's broken down enough for me to understanding. I feel like it might eliminate more note-taking than the first format would. "

Also, there were some lineages in which the order of words listed were not easily readable, which made the sentences chunky and somewhat confusing.,Because Passage 1 was organized in comprehensive paragraphs, so I could figure out what each paragraph would be focused on, how the sentences in each paragraph relate to each other in reaching the ""goal"" of the paragraph (and this ""goal"" of the paragraph was even mentioned at the start of each paragraph). Also, I could easily see how the paragraphs related to each other as well, and figure out what the entire passage was trying to tell me.","I remember that the first passage was broken up into full paragraphs, and then showed how the paragraphs were related to each other, and this representation was helpful for me to at first digest individual paragraphs and then fit the information within each paragraph into an interconnected whole. The second passage, on the other hand, was harder to read because it was broken up too much, into pieces/words that were too small and thus provided less help in allowing me as the reader to figure out how each sentence related to each other. Also, in some cases I found that the sentences I read by following the taxa were somewhat confusing and incomprehensible, as the words that followed each other did not fit in well grammatically.,Similar to what I reasoned in my previous response, I felt that passage 1's format had a better flow due to its organization in full paragraphs instead of the individual lines of sentences that you had to trace out through the taxonomic representation of words in passage 2. Also, it helped that passage 1's structure helped me understand the relationships between the paragraphs (chunks of knowledge), which allowed me to form a full interconnected structure of knowledge of the entire passage-- and this helped me understand what the passage was getting to as a whole, consequently allowing for better memory of the passage and its information.","Because passage 1 was split up into paragraphs instead of how in passage 2 the piece was cut up into shorter chunks of words that were organized into different taxa, which you would have to follow along in order to make sense of the distinct sentences. I felt that having the paragraphs tell you the key points of each part of the passage and then being able to piece together the different paragraphs into a complete whole was more helpful in getting me to understand and remember what the passages were saying. I also felt that passage 2 was split up a bit too much, and sometimes the grammar or sentence structure of passage 2 was a bit confusing and was not easily interpretable.,Kind of for a similar reason, passage 1 helped me better digest the information written, because it could allow me to read a more comprehensive lot of information instead of just many different split up sentences. It helped with my concentration that the information was organized into comprehensive parts instead of smaller units of sentences that you had to make connections within them yourself in order to get a sense of what the passage wanted to tell you. Just because passage 1 was easier to read and understand, I think it left a greater impression on my mind and allowed me to remember it better after a couple of days had passed."

If comparison is done, representation format of passage 2 was better since recollecting data in logical statement become easy for me to that of passage 1.",I think having a single headline and then related information in a paragraph below helped remembering related data together in logical statements. Also the scores are very evident how I did not mess with any test of passage 2 but kept forgetting few things in passage 1.

","I still think that passage 1 was the easier to read, and my reasons have been yet unchanged. Since passage 2 was hard to focus while reading, although is format might prove beneficial for the reader to recall its structure (which effect I noticed in my attempt to answer the multiple-choice questions for passage 2--the parts of the passage where I extracted the answers seemed to be more clear in my mind and thus more easily picked out and recalled; whereas in passage 1, I could not remember which name correlated to wich section of the passage), the sheer amount of information which I can recall made me feel more confident in answering questions related to passage 1 than 2. 
Also, comparing the process of answering the first (writing) question for each passage, I found that question 1 for passage 1 was much less challenging. I think that this is because I structured the knowledge gained from passage 1 in a more linear and feed-forward way, quite similar to a causal chain, the format which most people write an expository piece; on the contrary, information in passage 2 seemed more distributed--I was not able to extract the complete causal relationship of passage 2 in the amount of time given for me to read it, and I had to form this logical relationship based on my own surmise. ","I hold a similar opinion to the previous two responses that I have given. Passage 1 is much more fluid in logic and passage 2 is distracting. 
I think that my scores might not accurately reflect my level of understanding to both passages--as formerly discussed, I think that my understanding of the first passage was much more logical and uni-directionally linear, while my understanding for the second passage was more of a field of distributed ideas. Here are two anecdotal evidences. First, the time it took me to read the first and second passages were different: as I remember, I think that I spent around 6 minutes reading the first passage, while I spent around 10 minutes reading the second passage. Second, I felt that in the first trial, answering questions for the second passage was much more involved in going back to the passage and extracting the answer, where for the first passage the answers came generally from my memory; on the subsequent trials, the memory of the passages were not as important because I remembered many of the questions and their answers.

The author claims that people who watch TV would trust the hosts of TV shows based on their appearance. Consequently, the appearances of many TV hosts have been more valued than the quality of the show.

However, passage 1 is much easier to read than passage 2, to which I might attribute to attention (which I discussed in the former question) and familiarity with this form of communication. Also, comparing passage 1 to plain text, I feel that it gives me a easier glance at the complete picture of the passage, and therefore it is easier to follow its logic and easier for me to retrieve information after reading; however, a caveat is that I would be more easily guided or misguided by the author who summarized the logical connections of the first passage (which might or might not be accurate and/ or biased).
I feel that if I am already familiar to the content, then passage 2's format would be more helpful in recording and reviewing; when I am new to the content, I would prefer to read it in the traditional format (plain text) or the format of passage 1. ","Experience from answering questions today supported my feeling from last week about this question, that the format of passage 2 would perhaps be useful in reviewing and note-taking. Passage 2, although harder to read, would be more easily recalled in a content-addressed manner--that is, not completely in free writing but given the prompts in multiple-choice questions. The main downfall of passage 2 is that its structure seems distracting at first glance, but once the structure is obtained it would seem more clear. ","I also feel similar to my previous responses that passage 2, although harder to understand for me, might be more easily remembered. 
However, a new caveat that I feel about formats in passage 2 is that it might lead the student down the wrong tract when remembering. From my experience, since my memory of the first passage forms a logical stream while my memory of the second passage was like a field of distributed pieces, memory of passage 1 is inherently capable of more degrees of error correction--wrong information would lead more likely to inconsistent logic; while on the other hand, wrong information about passage 2 might not lead to inconsistency as likely because the strong logical connections were more local. Pesonally, I feel that when I was responding to questions (especially the writing response) about passage 2, I felt a bit of an unease; this was because that I was doubting whether the logical chain which I formed to answer the questions was the same as the passage's--I was trying to reverse-engineer the logic based on my field of ideas, while on contrast for passage 1 I obtained this logical chain when I was reading and remembering.

Passage 2 made more sense intuitively as to how to make sense of it, whereas Passage 1 took some time to familiarize myself. That being said, I liked the way Passage 1 was designed in that there weren't large blocks of text that I had to shift through (which was definitely the first thing that jumped out at me for Passage 2). I think Passage 1 was also helpful in giving me an overarching theme/question that I should be thinking about in relation to everything I read, more so than Passage 2; I feel like Passage 1 felt very neat. If there were more passages of that design to practice with then perhaps I would feel more strongly for Passage 1, but just going off of the knowledge recall tests in this experiment I think Passage 2 was simply more conveniently laid out. ","Although I said Passage 2 felt easier to read during the 1st Experiment Session last week, now that I think about it again I feel like Passage 1 might be easier to read than Passage 2. Even though the format requires more familiarization, Passage 1 feels easier to grab pieces of information from different subtopics and larger questions and categories than in Passage 2 where there are just blocks of information. Passage 2 is structured in a way that is similar to how I would read a book: from top to bottom and left to right. However, for most of the reading materials in my academic studies I rarely read this way; I usually just try to isolate the most important parts of the reading and pull the main ideas from these parts, filling in details later as needed. As someone who reads a lot of research papers this is especially the case. With this in mind, I think Passage 1 is more convenient to read because I don't feel overwhelmed with information and I can piece together the bits of information into a larger story more easily. ","I think both knowledge representation formats were easy to read, once I got familiar with them. Passage 2 made more intuitive sense as to how I should go about reading it. Passage 1 also felt easy to read in the sense that information was separated into smaller groups, which made things easier to digest (though looking at the passage again now I do feel a little overwhelmed with the amount of pages and information on each page). For the purpose of this test, both passages were easy enough to read for me to extract the particular information I needed for a question. However, if there wasn't the test component to reading the passages I think Passage 2 might be slightly easier to read simply because I feel like it takes less time to go through all the pages, even though it might not be as effective for retaining information. If there was a way to make the subsection I'm looking at in Passage 1 more clearly identifiable in terms of how it relates to the larger question (such as having a menu bar somewhere), I feel like that might have made it accessible a little more quickly.

I think for more theoretical subject matter such as data science or chemistry, it would be important for me to have information grouped together like in Passage 2, as opposed to each individual piece of information existing on its own. However, for more recall-based subjects like reading comprehension or biology, it would be helpful to have an idea of how a certain specific piece of information fits into larger concepts, processes and questions. As someone who is pursuing a career track related to neuroscience and biology, I feel like I have utilized some variation of both knowledge representations but not exactly formatted in this way, so with more practice I definitely could see myself incorporating these formats in my academic learning. ","Continuing from my previous response, I think Passage 1 is more helpful for my academic learning than Passage 2. In Passage 2, the way the blocks of information are grouped makes it difficult to understand why I need to know XYZ in the larger scheme of a topic. I was surprised to find myself unable to recall even just the basic ideas about Passage 2 in this session. I had vague recollections of some facts in my mind from the reading, but a lot of the details were missing pieces of information and I also had a hard time making the details relate to each other. On the other hand, even if I didn't recall a lot of things from Passage 1, for all the details I remembered in Passage 1 I had a much fuller and clearer picture as to how the details related to each other and the larger ideas of the reading. I'd hope to actually understand how things work and why things are the way they are for the things I study in my academic learning, as opposed to simply recalling bits and pieces of disjointed information, so I think Passage 1 would be the most helpful knowledge representation format. ","Even if I didn't have the test scores to compare my knowledge retention for the two passages, I feel much more confident in my understanding of the subject matter using the knowledge representation format of Passage 1 than Passage 2. Of course, it should be noted that the content of the passages matters; Passage 1 was about a story, and stories can fit into our memory more easily and for longer than facts and concepts (such as in Passage 2). It would be interesting to conduct a similar research experiment but with the knowledge representation formats switched for the two passages, to assess the extent to which the content of the passage affects the effectiveness of the representation format. Nonetheless, I felt that categorizing all the information of the passage as in Passage 1 made it easier for me to digest the subject material. As I mentioned in last experiment session's reflection, as someone in the field of molecular biology and medicine I will need to understand not only all the small details of a system or pathway such as the name of a protein, but also how those small details fit into systems and pathways on a broader scale. I feel like Passage 1 would be very useful with learning this type of information, since all the subsections point to a broader main question/idea that the passage is discussing. With Passage 2, I felt like I could barely recall any of the information during the second experiment session and even less information during today's experiment session, even though I thought I understood a decent amount of the information from the Passage. I think my written response scores are the best indicator for whether I understood the subject material, since I have to recall information from scratch. "

I don't the like the format of Passage 1 because having multiple pages means you have to remember which page the information is on or you have to predict under which category the question topic would most likely be under. Also with this format, it is harder to visualize a coherent timeline until the very end. Having a one-page format for Passage 2 made the story easier to understand and the nicer ""flow"" made it more enjoyable which probably aided in me remembering more.,I think both of the passages gave the same amount of information to the reader but for Passage 1, it felt like I waas trying to learn multiple things all at once. For Passage 2, there was a nicer flow and i could see how a preceding event led to the next one. If the point of academic learning is for me to be able to retrieve important information after longer periods of time, then the format of Passage 2 if far more helpful because it made The Buzz in Our Pockets much easier to understand. When I took notes in school, before exams, I would also try to condense them as much as I can into one page because summarizing this way makes it easier to understand and forces me to understand the learning rather than solely memorize. I'd describe the format of Passage 1 as too chaotic and overwhelming for me to have the ability to remember more of it. ","It is easier to read a format where you don't have to click through as many pages for several reasons: 1. it is easier to see a timeline between events and 2. you don't have to remember where in the representation each topic would be. Overall, the one page format is more reader friendly because it flows nicer and makes the reading more enjoyable whereas the first representation is more messy and chaotic.,I could remember more from passage 2 in a shorter amount of time because of the format. When I enjoy reading something, I am more likely to remember certain details even if they weren't mentioned in the questions. This is unlike for passage 1 where I feel I could only remember details that were mentioned in the questions. Representation 2 gave a clearer timeline which made it clearer to understand so since it was easier to read I could learn more."

This, along with shorter attention spans and limited air time, there is very little time for news to be taken seriously in TV.

The passage also talked about the phrase ""now this"" which is used to quickly move from story to story and not allow adequate time to be spent on each event in the news. People are also more likely to take newscasters seriously if they are attractive. The passage mentioned ""talking hairdos"" which really highlighted how much of a role physical appearance plays in the number of people watching the news.

The first one read a little more like a traditional passage that I'm used to seeing but broken up with arrows that showed the relationships between the different paragraphs so I liked that I could easily go back and find the section I wanted. It also allowed me to read out of order and piece together information in a way that made sense to me. I remembered certain questions and was able to see quickly which chunk of text to refer to and answer the questions in the order I chose. The second passage took a minute to figure out but I also liked that at was easy to navigate at a glance. This is the type of diagram that I generally make for my self when I'm navigating a difficult passage which is why I liked it a lot, and because I find it easier to digest the text with short phrases and arrows rather than large blocks of text. ","They both made sense for the information they presented and are both representations by which I take notes in class. The passage about Reena had a lot more little details to remember and so the boxes with little bits of information was easier to understand after seeing the example and getting some time with it. The passage about television had more paragraphs that connected the causes/effects between ideas and the structure of the boxes with the arrows showing that relationship made more sense because the passage had big ideas to convey instead of specific details. Things like books Reena read, or qualities of her parents were more specific and the smaller boxes with less information in each made it easier to see and relate them to each other. In the TV passage, I liked that it was easy to see the Christine Craft example in a box that came after the talking hairdos reference to show the funnel from big/broad ideas to narrower more specific examples. ","I think each representation was easy to read for the information it was presenting. The passage about TV had bigger ideas and the chart organized them in a way that made sense for how the paragraphs were organized. The Reena passage had more specific and small details that were important to the story and the chart arranged this information well by breaking it up. During both tests and written responses, I could see in my head where the information was in the charts and I could visualize where to ""look"" for information because they organized it efficiently for what they presented. I do not think I would have had as easy of a time if the TV passage was organized like the Reena passage and vice versa. With large blocks of text, I tend to skip around and gloss over details and the Reena passage did not allow me to do that. The TV passage also broke the passage down and each box contained related information so I felt like I read a lot more carefully and was able to use other information in the box to piece together what I had forgotten.

As I mentioned, I usually make visual diagrams of the texts I read in my notes to help me understand and in classes with heavy scientific readings, I've found I lean more towards the style of passage 2 because there are so many definitions and complex relationships. However, in classes where I'm reading a shorter articles or texts with less technical jargon, the format of the first passage is faster and easier for me since I don't spend as much time with definitions and focus more on the big picture. In my biochemistry class, I found making a visual like the one in passage 2 helped me see how processes happened and add in definitions and where certain organelles or enzymes connected to other processes in the body. Conversely, in my education classes where I learned about the school system, the format of passage 1 more closely resembled my notes since I wasn't focused on specific definitions but rather relationships and causes/effects as a whole. ","For me, it depends on the type of information being presented. Like I said, this is very similar to how I take notes and I found that in classes with a lot more specific, small details, such as my Biochemistry class, I find that a chart with more boxes and arrows with less information in each box makes sense because I can see the connection and each detail gets the space and arrows it needs to show that relationship. In the Reena diagram, there was a lot of detail to remember and read that was very specific so this format made sense to give each detail the spotlight. In my psychology classes, I find that a diagram like the TV one is better able to show how big ideas are related to one another and I can see cause and effect. This diagram still allows for information, but I spend much less time on very specific or tiny details and more on the study as a whole, its findings, and the effect on what phenomena I'm studying. Looking back, however, I felt like I remembered more of the Reena passage since I remembered a lot of tiny boxes.","It depends on the information I'm learning. Like I mentioned, I've used both formats when making notes for myself and it depends on if I'm organizing big ideas or detailed information that determines which representation I lean towards. I find that in classes with a lot of vocabulary/parts, the Reena passage format makes sense. When I was learning about the citric acid cycle in biochemistry, this format worked because I could see the order through which substrates were made but also I could see what else these parts related to, like if they showed up in other processes or had other functions. I could add definitions and elaborate as I needed and show relationships with this format without being overwhelmed by the information. Conversely, in my psychology classes, I found a format like passage 1 to be more helpful because often times the vocabulary/specific details didn't require as much effort as being able to relate a concept to a study or see large scale relationships between ideas.

The first passage could be better used like the eel example to connect ideas. The second one was alright but the writing was difficult to comprehend so that made it hard to use. I would have preffered a paragraph format more for passage 2."

For example, it was standard for musicians to play solos that were short (32 bars?) and this saxophone player did just that (aside from the one piece that was specifically mentioned due to him playing it from beginning to end).

He stuck strictly to the limitations of his era and the genres of music that he played, such as swing music, which featured very short solos making it difficult for him to be recognized as a solosit. Further contributing to this difficulty was both his preference and tendency to play in ensembles as opposed to trying to play more solos, though the passage did highlight a particular piece that was recognized due to the fact that it is the only piece that this musician was recorded playing from start to finish as a soloist. He also had played with extremely well-known artists such as Billie Holiday.

He was an extremely talented individual who played alongside well-recognized musicians, one of them being Billie Holiday. Though he was often in the recording studio or playing a key part in ensembles, he was not individually recognized as he tended and preferred to play within the larger ensemble or remain within the limitations of both his era and genre (ex. swing) that led to relatively short solo/featured parts.

Even though it seemed like there was more to read with the first format, the straightforwardness in conjunction with not having to figure out a whole new format made reading and understanding the passage much easier/faster. ,I feel that I learned a substantial amount of information about both topics as a result of the two forms of presentation, though I would prefer the first. ","The first passage was a lot easier to follow, especially within a time constraint. Because the boxes generally moved from left to right, it was natural for my eyes to follow the piece and I did not have to put much second thought into what I should be reading next. Rather, I could focus a lot more on the content itself. The second passage required a lot more effort into figuring out the format as the tree chart-style took a little bit to figure out, especially with the labels and arrows. ,I think that the easy-to-follow style of the first passage in addition to it having a significantly fewer number of slides made it quite simple to refer back to information when I needed to, such as when I was asked to answer the multiple-choice questions. I would imagine that in different settings of academic learning that it would also prove to be helpful to be able to easily locate and refer back to information, and passage 1 does a great job of allowing for these actions. ","I think that passage one was easier to read because the format was easier to follow, especially in a shortened amount of time. Because it was one that was/felt as new as the second passage, it took a lot less time to adapt and felt like something I was used to reading, though it was a lot more concise than regular readings. ,I think that especially having revisited this information a couple of times and even being asked to recall information, I generally feel that I am able to remember a lot more of the first passage. I'm not sure if this is attributable to the format of the passage or simply just a bias, but I definitely think that I have retained a lot more information from the first passage. "

I can't recall much of the passage because I am sleepy right now. From what I do remember, Count Basie was in the passage as well as someone with a name that started with a ""B."" The article also talked about a competitive atmosphere in music, and the hard work that the musician went through to make progress in the field. I also remember something about musicians having multiple jobs. 

Overall, it's easier to remember information when it's broken down, concept by concept, rather than coming at you all at once. It's similar to a powerpoint presentation.

Two researchers in South America were studying ants and wanted to study a very specific type of ants (the name which i forget). They speculate that the ants evolved with the jumping trait randomly. The ants also have very fast jaws that decelerate as they chomp down in order to protect their bite. Their bites hurt. Trying to catch the ants is like trying to catch hot, freshly-popped popcorn. The ants have an ability to bounce around 10x their body height, which gives them an advantage of gaining a new approach in attack (and also helps them escape from predators). They have two dominant combat methods, I think one is the really powerful jaw and the other is the jumping. They can also hit their jaws against the ground really fast and bounce their predators one way  and themselves the other way.

These ants have antlers/claws on their head that allow them to have unique defense and offense mechanisms. The researchers (and others) believe that these traits evolved accidentally. The ants are able to slam their heads onto the ground so hard that their enemies bounce backwards and they bounce in the opposite direction. This bounce can also give them a new vantage point for fighting. Their antlers are very strong, but have an evolved slowing-down/trigger mechanism so that the ants do not harm themselves. The ants are one of the strongest species of ants because of their powerful antlers/jaws. I believe they also prey on other ants.

The evolution of these jaws is speculated to have been accidentally. The ants' jaws are very strong. They have two main defense mechanisms; a jump escape and a powerful ground hit. The ants are able to slam their jaws on the ground which propels them in (a generally uncontrollable in the sense that they don't know what direction it is sometimes) an overhead direction which gives them an escape but also a new perspective for attack. They also can hit the ground and propel their attacker and themselves in opposite directions. Their jaws have a slowing-down mechanism so that the power of the jaws slamming together does not hurt the ants.

It allowed me to have enough insight on the story to answer the questions semi-correctly, but it wasn't user-friendly enough for me to say that I actually learned anything. The main take back from passage 1 was not the actual contents of the story, but instead how frustrated I was trying to piece together this flow chart puzzle. 

I often get bored trying to digest information from long, drawn-out passages, so the format of passage 2 allowed me to quickly grasp the overall topic for each passage, and the body within it told me exactly what i needed to know in relation to that topic. If you were to ask me to recall information about the evolution of the ants, I would be able to identify something that was below that heading in the box (i.e. researchers speculate the behavior might have been randomly adapted). Passage 2's method was pretty helpful for my academic learning. ","If Passage two was also a story like Passage one, I would have been able to retain more information for later recall. Content aside, passage two had a great organization in my opinion. I like that it was easy to find information because it was all on one page, as opposed to the several pages for Passage one. It also had full sentences and above each paragraph included a quick descriptive couple of words that indicated what each section entailed. The flow chart was a little confusing because it seemed a little choppy, but it wasn't nearly as bad as passage one's maze.   ",I liked that passage 2 used headers for each body of text. It made it easier to find information efficiently and I wasn't nearly as frustrated as I was with passage 1.

I was able to read through the second passage and remember more because of the way the information was organized on the page. The first passage was easier to remember for short term, but was easily forgotten. I remember more of the emotion or mode of the story rather than the actual facts.

Some arguments against text messaging include messages becoming less personal, and steering people into the direction of having significantly less social interaction face to face.

I didn't need to try and remember where many small boxes were, it was easier to memorize where 5 or 6 bigger boxes were with more information in them. It was easier to answer the questions with the bigger boxes because they were easier to navigate. ","I thought Passage 2 was easier to read because of the way the information was presented. Having fewer boxes that contained more information was easier fro me to remember and was easier to recall as an image in comparison to Passage 1 that was a long web of facts that stretched over many different links. I had to focus on where the links to what information was while I was trying to formulate answers to the questions being asked. When answering the questions to Passage 2, it was much easier to find and recall the information from the Passage because it was easier to memorize the web that had few but in depth parts. It was easier to memorize a central idea to each of the 5 or 6 boxes rather than remember the details spread out over 20 different little boxes within other links. I probably got more questions right on Passage 2 than Passage 1. I think I also finished Passage 2 in less time. It was easier for me to memorize the few key details from Passage 1 that I had previous associations with, like the movie The Departed,I have watched, and the argument that text messaging reduces human interactions which I had written an essay on last year. I didn't remember the two inventors of the text message which I find a pretty important detail and I didn't remember the significance of the War of Independence without seeing it. In conclusion, Passage 2 was much easier to remember due to the simplicity of the graph being presented and only having to remember 5 or 6 key ideas that were being presented in comparison to 20 or so facts that were presented in Passage 1. ","I think Passage 2 was easier to read because the information was given in a way that was easier to remember. I didn't have to navigate through multiple different details to find other details. Passage 2 was a much easier spatial map for me to internalize and remember where all of the details were to the best of my abilities. Clearly this reflect in my data. I scored the exact same 7/9 on the test questions for passage 2. Passage 1 results do fluctuate after I read the article. Although I'm not sure how the written response is graded, I feel that the written response for the second passage was much better because I just remembered more of the specific details because of the way the information was represented. When the information is presented in a way that there are 5-6 boxes to remember, it was much easier for me to remember in comparison to the 20 something little details I needed to navigate through. Passage 2 was also easier to read because it was clearly precise paragraphs in comparison to short details presented in Passage 1. "

If I made an easy to replicate chart of information that is separated into 5 or 6 boxes, the information is much easier to remember. It's also easier to remember the formation or image of the 5-6 box diagram rather than a diagram with 20 little boxes. It's easier to chunk the information with less boxes too. Although the passages are longer, it's better to have a paragraph with a central main idea rather than strings of facts. Central ideas I feel are easier to remember rather than long lists of associations that would need to be recalled in order to accurately retain information in the Passage format. I found myself not remembering where all of the information was when I had to answer questions for Passage 1 and found Passage 2 much easier to complete. ","I find Passage 2 more helpful to my academic learning because it's most important to get a concrete understanding of the topics and then the details rather than 20 facts. If it's a vocabulary quiz for example, memorization is necessary but for application exams like math, a bunch of facts is not going to suffice as a helpful learning tool when studying. Passage 2 summarized the main ideas in an easy to read format and made it easier for me to remember the information being presented because I had an easy to remember image in my head of hat the web looked like, and where each box of information was located, and tried my best to not leave any out when writing the summary at the end. ","Passage 2 was presented in a format that would be helpful for my academic learning because it was easier to remember. When it is exam time and I need to be able to recall different topics of information, the spatial map was much easier to recall. I didn't need to spend much time thinking about it either. I just tried to remember where each of the topic was on the screen and recite that information the best that I could. I think it shows in my data that the information was retained the best with a Passage 2 format in comparison to Passage 1. Passage 2 was able to cover a lot of information and it was just easier to remember it all accurately. "

- Berry's last noted solo (I can't remember the name of the song) could be compared to a cathedral: powerful, colorful, enamoring. This was also his only performance that featured him from beginning to end. 
- Berry's performance of Henderson's C sharp in minor was commonly remembered as odd and haunting, yet quite relaxing.

- Due to the more popular style of music at the time, it is not very surprising that this character's talent went unnoticed for a while. 
- During swing songs (which were more popular at the time), solos tended to be short, 20-30 seconds on average. This made it a bit harder to gain tons of recognition as quickly. 
- Swing music was also seen as party or dancing music rather exclusively, limiting the target population that would hear his music as well. 
- The main character was known for being incredibly selfless and kind towards his bandmates, putting their needs above his own most of the time. 
- Arguably, this trait of his may have ""damaged"" his career opportunities to some extent. 
- The last song that the main character was known for was quite significant: it was the only song he played in that featured him from beginning to end. 
- His playing of Henderson's C minor was remembered as haunting, yet relaxing.

Second, it explains that compared to the past, text messaging has allowed for an increased amount of connections with others compared to our ancestors and also allows for communication over long distances. Though, Fields argues that text messaging can be potentially damaging to our society. This is due to the lack of in-person interactions and also the lack of human connections. She argues that text messaging takes away the connection from relationships and results in a very robotic society.

From there, the passage discussed the influence and impacts of text messages. Text messages had a cultural impact and had appeared in many shows and movies. Additionally, text messages had allowed for faster communication over long distances and also was a great improvement of the past. Also, the passage referred to ""time is money"" stating that text messages have allowed for faster communication therefore our lives were more convenient. Though, there were many criticisms of text messages. One person, Fields, had said that humans have lost social connection due to text messages. People have started to have less in person and social interactions with text messages being so fast and convenient. Additionally, she argued that text messages are not the same as letters, which has a strong impact on human feeling. Though, others can argue that messages will bury out all the unnecessary interactions. This passages argues that both sides has good points.

First, the passage shows that the development of text messages has brought many changes, including cultural change in media and also how people communicate. People are now able to communicate over long distances and have a quicker way to reach others compared to letters. Also, the phrase ""Time is money"" is really applicable when talking about text messages because texts save time and allow people to focus on other aspects of their life. Though, on the contrary, many people, such as Fields, argue that text messaging has been a damaging factor in society, especially for social connections. She argues that with text messaging, people spend less time engaging in physical and in-person social events that lead to deeper connections. There is also an argument stating that text messages are just not the same as letters, which provides this uniqueness in physical communication. Overall, there are both good and bad aspects to text messaging. While social connections could be lost, there could also be an increase in spending time on other aspects.

First, it explains the ""Now...what"" statement and how counterintuitive it is because after this statement is presented, it mostly likely is to introduce irrelevant information. This statement adds to the point that television is to share useless information. Additionally, this passage shows that televisions offer no real value because the information they offer is not relevant and it is damaging to the viewer's mindset because it requires a short-attention-span and not paying attention. It also shows that the entire industry is very toxic because news reporters are hired largely based on their appearance and how they will attract viewers. There was a case where a news reporter was fired due to sexist reasons and appearance reasons.

First, it points out that there is really no point in watching television because when audiences watch television, they are either occupied with something else or what is airing is irrelevant information. The passage brings up the ""now..then"" statement stating that when this statement is presented, it is most likely to say what the information we watched wasn't important and then brings up something they consider important, which is most likely irrelant. Additionally, the television industry is very corrupted in the sense that who they hire is mostly based on looks. The people that we see on television are usually hired because of their appearance.

Along with that, the author is also trying to explain how the television industry itself is a very toxic place. There was much evidence that television is not informative. First, it states the phrase ""Now...then"" which says that the previous information is not important and the next news is much more important. This illustrates that watching television is a waste of time as not everything is important. Suppoting this, the author also states that the television is the best for people who are doing something else as it is really merely for background sound that does not need the full attention to. Regarding the television industry, people are hired solely for their looks. There was a law suit where someone was fired due to issues of sexism.

The author says that the 8 minute segments are designed so that a viewer can join in at anytime and not feel too far behind or lack context because even if the viewer joined halfway through one story in just a short while there will be a completely new story and the viewer wont have to be confused.
The author also says that the news anchors have to be attractive, he had a case of one female reporter who got fired because of what she believes as sexism and her not meeting the cultures beauty standards.
The author says the news anchors are talking hairdos in that they have to look good and that this sentiment is not new. In ancient times people who deliver bad news were punished so in order to make it so that the bad news giver is not hated having them be attractive helps.

The Now This segments make it so that the news shifts from one topic to another without giving people enough time to fully process the previous topic.
This 8 minutes per segment strategy was put in place so that people who join in midway through a broadcast don't feel like they've missed too much because no matter what in a few minutes a different unrelated topic will pop up.
The appearance of the newscaster is also important which is shown through the author's description of them as talking hairdos. 
More attractive anchors are often chosen to represent the news on TV because if the person looks pleasing to the average person the people are more likely to keep watching and this was demonstrated in the case of the one reporter I think her name was Cindy something. She sued the news station on the basis of sexism because she believed that she was fired because of her appearance. 
The author thinks that jumping to a new segment regardless of whether the previous segment included serious things like death, or natural disaster is harmful in that the quick changes in topic don't allow us to properly process what happened.",c,b,a,b,d,a,c,a,d,,Wed Jun 01 2022 10:01:48 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),9,1,112,H2,Wed May 25 2022 10:42:37 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),Wed May 25 2022 10:32:58 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),H2,Sat May 28 2022 09:56:46 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),,H2,Wed Jun 01 2022 10:16:52 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),Wed Jun 01 2022 10:09:57 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),"I think Passage 2 was easier to read because it was broken down into digestible chunks whereas Passage 1 has broken down by like every couple of words. When answering the comprehension questions, for Passage 2 it was easier to determine where to look because I know what the topic of each box is for Passage 1 I tried to reference back to the flow chart if I was confused about an answer but then I just decided to go off of memory because I didn't know where to look and I'd waste too much time searching for it. Passage 1 was not only hard to reference it was difficult to read in the first place as it lost the flow of a typical sentence I found myself rereading the previous box or words on the arrow because not only to the sentences divide at the intro they also divided at the subject and sometimes they divided at the verb so it was hard to separate one thought from another in Passage 1. I used my mouse less for Passage 2 because it was easier to follow the flow of a sentence but for Passage 1 I had to use my mouse to help my eyes follow the flow of a sentence.  That being said I think I read Passage 1 faster than I read Passage 2, but I think I understood Passage 2 better. ","Because the breaks in the passage weren't so frequent, when I read Passage 1 on Wednesday it was so hard to even follow because the sentences broke and branched off at like every few words making me have to use my mouse to trace a line through each sentence so that my eyes don't get lost in the mess. I didn't like Passage 1 because of the way it was organized. Passage 2 was much better organized. I liked how there were a few sentences in each box that made it so that thought was contained neatly. Each box felt like it represented an instance or a theme, so it was easier to understand too. The sentences weren't fragmented allowing me to process each sentence properly without getting it confused with a nearby sentence either. 

Another thing that makes it a little harder to answer this question is that the two Passages were different types, if both Passage 1 and Passage 2 were narratives or if both were informational, then the two would be more comparable, Passage 1 was much more accessible to a normal person than Passage 2 because the characters in Passage 2 are so unfamiliar I was reading it but I didn't care about it at all. Passage 1 I had more personal connection to it as I was reading it I was thinking ohh yeah the people who do local news are attractive the news segments are only about 8 minutes long even as I was watching the news on Wednesday evening I was thinking about it I can assure you that I wasn't thinking about Reena. Even though Passage 1 was incredibly hard to read due to it's formatting I might have scored better on those tests just because the material was more relatable and therefore formed stronger connection in my brain I was connected to Passage 1, Passage 2 was about random people I don't know and can't relate to it doesn't stick as well regardless of the format so I wouldn't be surprised if I remember less from it today even though I felt I understood it better when I read it on Wednesday. If both Passage are the same type narrative or informational and we did this study again I feel like the results for which type of formating is better might be clearer but that's just my opinion.",Passage 2 had fewer abrupt breaks. It had a nicer flow because it didn't break in the middle of a sentence as Passage 1 did. I liked how Passage 2 was broken up by idea rather than by every few words seemingly at random like Passage 1. I think Passage 2 was also easier to read because it was a narrative that is easier to follow than the facts presented in the piece that was a critique.

Reena enters the church with confidence which is a trait she carries fmo her childhood. She decided to change her name from Doreen to Reena and demanded people call her her preferred name by not responding to her old name, correcting people who misreferenced her, and staring and pointing at them. Reena and the narrator weren't meant to be friends or at least weren't friends naturally since they didn't have a ton of common interests, Reena was very into history and Mature topics such as Hitler's invasion of Poland or Spains Civil War at the age of 12 but the narrarator was more into age appropriate literature. The narrator also thinks that Reena is beautiful but age does show on her face a little. The narrator then reflects on Reena's family and how her dad was funny but kept her a a distance, her mother strict forceful but also equally fun and effective. Reena was overwhelming even with siblings she acted like an only child. Reena treated the narrator poorly cuz she was impatient with the narrator.

Reena walks in with a lot of confidence almost as if shes the one officiating the funeral. The narrator recall memories of her childhood with Reena. One of the instances she recalled was of how Reena's real name was something like Noreena (i can't remember) but she wanted everyone to call her Reena so she'd correct them if they used the wrong name, refuse to respond to her old name, glare at people if they used the wrong name, and stomp her feet. This shows that she is an assertive character. The narrator also says that Reena has aged well. Then the narrator continues to reflect on how she and Reena aren't alike and how they wouldn't have been friends if it weren't for their mothers being friends. She talked about how Reena seemed more grown than her because she'd read and talk about Hitler's invasion of Poland, and the Civil War in Spain. Meanwhile the narrator was still captivated by books meant for her age. She said that Reena was impatient with her and made her feel less than. She also recalled how Reena's dad humored her but also kept her at a distance, Reena was not an only child but commanded attention as if she were. Reena's mother was effective and fun.

Reena had mature interests such as history like Hitler invading Poland, the Spanish Civil War etc. but the narrator was still interested in children's stories. Reena apparently didn't have patience for the narrator and the narrator said they wouldn't be friend if it weren't for their mothers putting them together.

This format sort of pre-organizes them for you. This way even when reviewing for an exam or just for the sake of better understanding a subject, if I know where I struggle I can just reread that box or branch of boxes rather than search through the entire passage to find the concept I am struggling with. I already use a similar strategy by highlighting different themes or main ideas in different colors but even then one paragraph may have multiple colors in it this format organizes the passage by theme so it is easier to process.","I think Passage 2 for the same reason I stated before, it looks like it is organized by theme so that would be very helpful in academic learning for subjects such as English when writing a summary of a book I just read or for history when trying to break down the aspects of the topic just covered. It also doesn't break off too many times which is nice. Another thing I liked about Passage 2 was that it wasn't always sequential, Passage one had a lot of circular box systems that seems like it's describing a series of events but it's hard to tell which is the starting event because there were so many breaks but Passage 2 had one central box and multiple boxes branching off of it and I think that can be very useful for a class like History because I'm thinking about a lesson I recently had on the causes of WW1 that's not just a series of sequential events there are multiple reasons each having their own sequence but all centralized to one thing I think Passage 2 style will be a great knowledge representation for that where each box can be a reason, in it explain what the reason is, then branch a box off of each of the reason boxes to say this caused this which caused this and explain each box. Don't break the boxes midsentence that's confusing. Even for my neuroscience courses Passage 2 can be a great way for me to practice and review my knowledge on things like learning and memory or sleep because those are conceptual topics. ",I think I'd like Passage 2 for my academic learning because it is organized by the main idea or topic. That is helpful because it helps me mentally categorize information better so that when I recall it I can recall all related things too because it's pregrouped. Another reason Passage 2 would be helpful is because it was able to show how one thing led to another like for the narrator feeling unwelcomed because Reena was impatient that was after we learned about how she didn't have raw edges and was reading all this grown-up stuff about Hitler so hearing how the narrator felt after learning about Reena made it stick better and that was because of the sequence.

Passage 1's format can be helpful when there is no storyline and just a variety of information put together whereas Passage 2's format is helpful to read through a story.","Passage 1's format is helpful for information that is needed to be split in multiple subsets whereas Passage 2's format is helpful for stories or a story line. For Passage 1, it is easier to comprehend because all the information was presented in one spot, whereas for Passage 2, you would have to make more inferences. For Passage 2, it is easier to understand the storyline and there were many different sections that formed into understanding the main character. It was also more easier to remember the details in Passage 2."

This is in contrast to the first passage which, while containing segments of roughly a paragraph worth of writing, had just the right amount of separation and flow needed to grasp a full picture of what was happening. The strengths of the first passage style were the adequate level of context and detail and the helpful use of visual flow, while the weaknesses of the second passage are directly opposite of this in that there was a lack of context and detail while also having an overwhelming level of visual flow. Furthermore, the literature prompt of the second passage would seemingly benefit more from the paragraph style when compared to the panda passage, though the two were presented in the opposite way.","I think the omission of context, small details, and personality/flavor in the second passage made it very hard to follow and simply got the main points across. Furthermore, by nature of passage 2 being a story, context and personality/flavor is supremely important. When answering the free-form description of what I remembered, I found myself drawing from the context clues and details provided in the questions as opposed to the passage itself. Perhaps if the style of passage 2 were accompanied by more context in paragraph formats such as how passage 1 was portrayed, the two would balance each other out. While I believe passage 1 was easier to read, the content was a bit dryer in comparison and thus I felt that I had a harder time remembering the content. Perhaps the two different formats would be easier to understand if the content had been swapped. Still, the first passage was much easier to read in isolation of the questions compared to the second passage format, which felt very barebones and incomplete.","Passage 1 contained much more context and details surrounding the main exposition/content compared to passage 2 which only contained isolated exposition detached from its context. While this ease of reading may not be reflected in the test scores, this is likely due to my preference for literature style passages in combination with the fact that this piece of what I assume is fiction was more memorable and novel to me than the information on Panda conservation. As such, the main ideas were remembered more easily. Furthermore, the test questions themselves of passage 2 provided the much needed context clues much of the time and often were actually what helped make sense of the disjointed exposition of passage 2. In fact, without the context clues of the test questions, I am sure that my written responses would have been less detailed. In terms of the written responses, I performed markedly better on the written responses for passage 1 when compared to passage 2. This is likely due to the first passage having the additional context required to better grasp details while the question itself has no context clues to draw on. Thus, perhaps while passage 2's barebones style of presentation may be more conducive to getting across main ideas, passage 1's context paragraph style of presentation is certainly necessary to grasp details and make sense of the picture as a whole, despite the main exposition being more muddy."

In contrast, the second passage format contained far too much visual cues to the point where it was distracting and confusing while also providing far too few details and context. This was especially salient in the literature example where we are no longer able to grasp the perspective of the narrator and the contexts necessary to answer the passage questions.","I feel that the paragraph format of passage 1 is much more necessary for a literature style story that contains its own memorable scenes or details, while the barebone approach of passage 2 is more conducive to learning more quantitative based/scientific ideas as this content can be more dry at times, thus less interesting/unique, and thus less memorable. For instance, I very much remember certain details of the literature style story, but many of these details were drawn from the context clues of the questions themselves. Conversely, the less interesting and less flavorful text on pandas had little that stuck out to me and it was easier to get lost in the paragraph/I was not as captivated. Thus, I feel that including both styles of passages are most helpful as they cater to a greater variety of needs, but that this may only be necessary in certain fields such as the sciences where visual representations are less easily created in one's head.","As is evident, the style of presentation of Passage 2 is helpful enough to grasp main ideas and thus perhaps aids in answering multiple choice questions. Furthermore, it can provide a framework (schema) from which we can build off of after reading something presented with context as in passage 1. When it comes to actually defining learning however, I would argue that passage 2's format is much worse in assisting in raw understanding as one would simply be listing off facts they remember and meaningless plot points that may not be properly contextualized. Thus, I believe either passage 2's format should be provided before reading passage 1 format and thus serve as a preface skeleton from which one can build off of or passage 2's format should be presented after passage 1 to help in aiding memory of the main points as review. Thus I do not believe passage 2's format is as helpful in actually absorbing knowledge in a meaningful way as evidenced by the difference in written response scores when compared to the comparable/if not better test scores of passage 2. Furthermore, I believe this also adds to the literature questioning the effectiveness of multiple choice questions in the first place as, despite having good scores on the test questions for passage 2, even I don't feel like I fully grasp all the details of the story in passage 2."

Passage 1 was more interpretive, the questions gaged one's understanding in an analytical aspect. The paragraph styled web-structure in Passage 1 was more coherent because it had to be in order for a reader to understand beyond the words, which wasn't required in Passage 2.

They use these jaws for attacking prey in the leaf litter (of which they live and nest), to escape predators, and to attack predators. Evolution has helped their jaws to become powerful and safe for them. The jaws build up power in the muscles of the jaw, opening and building up potential energy until they are released, snapping powerfully.  They have a mechanism that slowly takes away some of the power, so as not to hurt themselves in the process. They can use their powerful jaws to jump, specifically for their escape jumps, which launch them away from predators.

Their jaws are very powerful, so they have an adaptation that makes sure they won't hurt themselves, called mandibles.

I definitely know more about barn owls now than I did before reading passage 2, and I felt that i performed reasonably well on both the free recall and the multiple-choice recall.","it's puzzling that my pretest score and test score were exactly the same. I felt like I knew a lot more right after looking at the passages, but apparently not. I'm curious to know which ones I missed, and whether they were the same or different questions that I missed each time. How was the written response scored? "

However, critics think that text message defuncts because it alienates people and let people miss other aspects of human experiences. It shortens the attention spans, because, for instance, people multitask while text messaging each others.

There is one specific movie whose plot is developed based on the channel of text messages. Also, it helps save more time than phone call and what is written can be preserved. Alternatively, critics suggest that it alienates people by limiting other forms of human experiences and shortens our attention on the thing we are doing, specifically, texting. This is because we can simultaneously focus on other chunks such as watching TV while sending texts.

Also, text messaging is a quicker and more intimate way of communication as it saves the time for organizing incomplete thoughts. It  helps us reach the number of people our ancestors could not in their entire period of lifetime, too. However, critics like Fields suggest that it limits the realm of human's other experiences. Also, while we text others, we might be less concentrated and split our attention to other simultaneous activities such as TV-watching or chitchatting.

",Passage 1 was definitely more effective for my academic learning because I was able to retain much more information for a longer period of time.

From elementary school, my teacher had taught us to make graphs like that to prove that you really understand the materials. I guess the second format would be even more helpful if I'm used to the format. It's like a map, and whenever you think about one concept shown on the graph, it reminds you of its intricate relationship with other concepts. The first format is more direct, and easier to find materials because I know in which section I read that information. ","I realize when I was recalling the information I've read, it's so much easier to do that for passage 1. I believe I remembered many useful information. Also, when I was doing the multiple choice question this time, I was doing it based on the things I recall. For the second passage, I can only recall a few keywords. When I was doing the questions for passage 2, I mostly was recalling which choice did I choose last time since I couldn't recall much information. ","I conclude this using the test scores. Apparently, I'm still able to recall Reena to a large extent, even a week after. For passage 2, I found it really hard to remember anything. There's a sharp drop in my score. The knowledge wasn't absorbed, and it didn't stick in my head too. However, it's also worth noting that the materials of the 2 passages are different. One was a story, and the other was very informative on statistics. I could be more interested in novels. "

The passage starts by introducing a common phrase in news reporting, ""Now...this..."", which means what the audience will see next has no connection with what they just saw.

Another example the writer uses is with the ""talking hairdos"", which stands for the television personalities carefully picked and crafted to make sure the viewers are pleased and more likely to trust these people. A woman named Christie (??) was one of these personalities until she was cast aside because her viewers didn't find pleasure in seeing her face on television anymore.

I found Passage 2 highly organized and disorganized at the same time, because while all of the information was connected and I could see these connections on the pages, I got overwhelmed with the sheer amount of details I might have missed if I didn't sit there and follow each and every connection to the end. A lot of details I had a hard time pinpointing whereas with Passage 1 all of the details I knew exactly where to go and exactly how they connected with each other. Personally, I believe that Passage 1 is way more efficient when it comes to digesting the information and answering the questions. Despite this, Passage 2 is easier if the material is less interesting and I would like to skim through and get the basic idea. Basically, it's easier to pick out specific answers because everything is so ""spread out"". Passage 1 requires reading and adequate comprehension of the material to answer the questions. In conclusion, Passage 1 was easier to digest.","Passage 1 was easier to read because the information was contained. The relationship between these different groups of text were concisely and clearly defined, keeping the format nice and easy to follow. However, Passage 2 had too many connections, all over the place, and was confusing and overwhelming to read and follow. The relationships were defined, although not concisely, which made it all the more difficult to read.","Passage 1 was easier to read due to how the information was organized in a concise manner, very constricted to just one page which made it less overwhelming. Based on my scores, I still agree with my previous statement, because I was more willing to read through all of Passage 1, but not Passage 2. I read through Passage 1 more completely than Passage 2 because I assumed I could afford to; all of the information was contained and I could see it all in front of me at the same time, which made it less daunting. Also, the connections between each section of text, each point, were simple and clear, which I appreciated. "

Reena was one of many children her mother and father had, but she somehow managed to make it seem as though she were an only child. Additionally, her father kept his distance from her and her mother didn't seem to like her very much. Reena was just selfish, and she had a way about her that could intimidate almost anyone into going along with her agenda.

For example, when studying for my college biology course, I used a study method similar to Passage 1's format; I had a main idea and then I connected other ideas. I found it very useful to rewrite my notes whilst making these connections because it was very visually appealing and my brain could better absorb the content. However, I tried Passage 2's format for a couple of lessons, and I found myself getting overwhelmed and lost. With science based courses, or at the very least courses which are very ""content heavy"" and ""memorization based"", Passage 1 would work wonderfully to condense your notes and connect main ideas, further cementing ""chunks"" of information into your brain so they stick. Passage 2 would be better suited for classes that are concept based, or are English courses. For example, when I would be plotting out a story idea for creative writing, I would use a method similar to Passage 2. In classes that I needed to grasp the concepts in, not necessarily memorize details, I would also use something similar to Passage 2 to map out, in my head or on paper, how each concept relates to another. I believe this is extremely helpful because a lot of concepts need to be understood fully to apply them when taking an exam or working on higher level ideas within that course. ","Passage 1 is more helpful when it comes to content based classes; an example would be biology, a subject I used the formatting in passage 1 for studying before. Passage 2 would be more useful in humanities and concept based classes; I've used a format similar in my creative writing class, and it helped me brainstorm ideas. I don't see Passage 2 being useful to effectively study, but it can be useful to expand on knowledge one already has a grasp of.","Answering this based on my written scores, it would be reasonable to assume that neither of these formats would be beneficial to my learning. However, in an academic environment, as I've stated before, I've used variations of these formats for different courses and have been successful. Personally I'd prefer the format for Passage 1 as the simplicity makes me more likely to find all the answers I need, organized and clearly. This is further evident by my test scores for Passage 1, which never changed because I found that they were clearly stated and easy to find IF I just read through each paragraph of text. On the contrary, Passage 2 didn't contain any paragraphs, and barely any sentences. The ""map"" was all over the place, still within reason of course but nonetheless terrifying to look at and overwhelming at the beginning. Eventually I realized due to the ""spacey-ness"" of the text, I could locate the answers rather easily without reading much of anything. I feel as though my brain had to make a lot of connections with the story after I had located the answers and finished with the quiz. When I was writing the written response, I used all these isolated pieces of information I had quickly grasped onto and formatted them to fit logically together--I still didn't understand major parts of the story, and missed others all-together, and so my understanding was flawed in a major way. Thus I'm saying that Passage 2 made me ""lazy"" and ""exhausted"" mentally, and that's why I don't believe it will be good for me academically, in hindsight. As for Passage 1, it would required a lot of reading and rereading to cement those details in my mind, as I can easily discard or miss certain things due to the size of the paragraphs. The main idea I could grasp, but any other details--such as Christine Craft's name that I failed to remember each and every time--would escape me. "

In such a style, the author used a lot of arrows to illustrate the relationships of the content in the passage. It's way more clear and more direct for me to read due to I can have a logical chain in my mind about what is it about. Another reason why I like passage 2 better is that I can find what I want to know very quickly by following the logical chain. 

Passage 1 also uses some arrows, but it's not that useful for me. The arrow in passage 1 is used for connecting paragraphs, so I still need to read the entire paragraph to understand the relationships and find what I need. But passage 1 gives me a better reading experience indeed.","I feel that both these two formats of the articles bring me good memorization. I can remember more stuff from the first format, especially some close relations and reasoning stuff because I was reading complete paragraphs. However, the second format enables me to remember more logical stuff and I was trying to visualize the picture of that mindmap to recall details. To sum up, more detail was recalled from the second format, but more relations and reasoning were recalled from the first format.","I think that the format of passage 1 is easier to read because it's is divided into paragraphs but not single words or sentences. In that format, I can catch the logical relations in a sub-topic of the article more fluently. And I can also understand the purpose of why the author wrote it more quickly. However, the second passage's format is too ""separated"" for me. I can not understand what does the author write about or his/her goal. Although the logical chains may be easier to analyze in the second format, it does not bring me a good reading experience."

","I prefer the first format. For academic reading, I think it's very important to remember the key stuff after reading. At least for myself, I can still remember a lot of details from the first passage because I can read a complete paragraph without being interrupted. As the result, I may have a deeper understanding and memory of the paragraphs that I read. However, for the second format. I would say it may be helpful for somebody but not me.

The first one was easier to navigate, as in I didn't have much trouble knowing where to go to find information I'd previously seen. However, in the first one it was more difficult to read because the passages were denser and I had to search within them. In the second one, it was much easier to skim and easily find information (once I knew which category the information was in) but confusing to navigate between all the categories.,I think I like the second one better because the organization of the information makes it less overwhelming to find specific details since you can just skim and easily find key words. The first one was a little more draining to find information in, even if I knew where to look more often than I did for the second one. ","Because the key words were more spread out rather than densely clustered in paragraphs, it was easier to understand and mentally structure all of the information. I only had to glance over the entire flow chart to make meaning of the words whereas with the first article, it took more conscious effort to make all of the information cohesive and structured in my mind.,The first passage is more overwhelming because you have to make sense of all the long sentences in each paragraph before you can make meaning of the flow chart as a whole. In the second passage, you can focus less on understanding the author's writing and more on making connections between the concepts. ","It was less overwhelming because I could understand how different pieces of information were related to each other just by glancing over the map whereas with the first passage I had to read each passage to get information which was more tedious and mundane.,The information was easier to digest because I didn't have to read any long passages, so I felt more confident learning the information, and I felt more motivated to look for missing pieces of information that I needed to answer questions."

Passage one is easier to read because everything flows more smoothly as it is in complete sentences but there is a lot of information that can be overwhelming to see all at once and make me lost at times. Passage 2 is confusing in its organization but the limited amount of information makes it easier to take it all in and understand it. ,I find that both were helpful for remembering information. the first because it was easier to read and the second because there was less overall information so easier to take it in. ,the first one was easier to read and so i spent less time trying to understand the format and being able to learn the information. the second one because there was less filler information and just the key word were present it make it easier to take in information.

Someone who is too pleasing or displeasing can be seen as untrustworthy. Television news has become a form of entertainment.

The passage summarized the experience by stating that news, which is consumed over television, serves more as entertainment, rather than a full dissemination of information, due to the fact that people gauge the reliability of the news by how pleasing the face of the presenter is to them. The people who present the news must not be distractingly beautiful, but also not ugly, and thus the ideas that are presented on TV are judged as being more or less reliable based on who is presenting them.

Also, it was more legible. ","Passage one had information that was presented in big blocks of text, which made it difficult to focus on individual sections. While passage 2 was also difficult to navigate, it had categories which could be explored. The categories made it easier to remember what the focus of the passage was, unlike passage one, which presented everything all at once.","When it comes to ease of readability, I think being presented with these two passages in the broken down format first made it so I spent most of the time trying to understand how the passages were interconnected, rather than the content of the text. However, I do think that the text that connected the Reena passage (i.e. words such as ""which led to"" or ""so she was"") made the relationships between the nodes easier to visualize. I found the first passage harder to read than the second as it presented the information in larger chunks, which relied on me to produce the connections which were displayed in the Reena passage via the connective text.

Passage 2 actually adds value to the information by breaking down the individual branches.","When it comes to the ease of understanding, I think passage 2 does a better job in the sense that it allows the reader to visually see the connection between the nodes. As stated previously, passage 1 presents more information with less connective statements, which relies on the reader to create. If the reader doesn't make the connections that the text intends to create, the visualization of that information is more difficult to retain. Whereas with the second passage, the connections are already presented for the reader, and thus the interconnectedness within the passage is easier to visualize. "

Especially when each paragraph discusses one topic it makes it more easier to understand. For example, one paragraph just talked about why the panda was important to the Chinese while another paragraph talked about a memory that the guy had about the panda.",I find this helpful for my academic learning because i always seemed to do better when the information was in paragraphs. It is easier to understand because the information is clear and concise. As my scores indicate i did very poor on the owl passage and very well on the paragraph format.

In the second passage, It took a time to adjust my eyes and travel and read the details. It was hard to focus on details as the learning curve of the passage structure was high. The first passage was in a tree structure. As human beings when we have to read whole paragraphs, we don't prefer the structure as we are used to old ways of reading. As Krug said in his book that we scan things and don't like to read. Patterns like Z and F are easy to grasp than scrolling the content.,If I have to choose between passages 1 and 2, I feel 1 was better than 2. But It is hard to go back and match details. Many times I got lost when looking for details and clicked on the same items multiple times. It was hard to focus. It is because we are used to traditional reading methods and it is new to adapt.","Neither of them were easy to read. If I have to compare both the first one was better than second in terms of representation. The first paragraph was in tree format but I had to go back everytime to relate and check the questions and supporting answers. That was difficult. The second paragraph was horizontally too long. It was difficult to scan and provide answers effectively.,Both the representations were difficult in different manner. The first representation was a lot effort for my eyes and I wasn't able to keep track of what I was looking for! Maybe after some practice I can adapt learning with the passage 1 representation.","After comparing both the passages Passage 1's format was easier to read. The format of passage 1 was in tree structure where all the nodes were revealing the answers and describing the passage. It was easier to relate and read than passage 2. Passage 2 was difficult in comparison to Passage 1 because of its representation structure, where I had to scroll each time to see details. Passage 1 was easier because all the information in the nodes were shorter and easier to memorize while passage 2 contains long detailed paragraphs that were difficult to locate.,In the academic learning passage 1's format is helpful and it is widely used format. All the branding and other materials, where users don't need to pay much attention and can quickly grasp details, infographics are used there. The structure of passage 1 was similar to the infographic, but there was only single difference between them. The representation of the passage requires users to go back everytime while infographics are straight, easy representation with graphics."

","I was able to extract information from the first easily than the second, but was able to recall the second as it was more interesting","They were about the same in ease of reading. The first passage about decisions was a little easier to scan through and get the gist. However, the Barn Owl passage was more visualising and stimulating and the word choice helped in remember it better.
