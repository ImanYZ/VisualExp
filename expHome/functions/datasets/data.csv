The information about the National Zoo and Dr.Wang was very different but they look the same in my head because they were spatially the same.  ","I am somebody who likes to chunk information into sections. The paragraph form really helped with this. I can mentally chunk what information comes first and what happened when, when I'm looking at the story all together. The first passage could be read in any order. It could go left to right, right to left, etc. So many different combinations for reading it. I think having a more linear approach helps a lot. "

For the scenarios where I would opt for a knowledge graph over reading a full text, I would choose Passage 1's knowledge graph over Passage 2's.","Passage 1 was a lot efficient at conveying information at a glance; with Passage 2, reading the full graph was not that much less work than reading a full text but the Passage 1 representation allowed for understanding of story's main ideas without a full, in-depth reading."

Alexandro, Isabel's son, lived in Miami and wished for his mother to visit, but Isabel did not want to due to the paperwork
Finally, he got tickets for the Miami State Ballet & Baryshnikov, a defected USSR dancer that would never be seen in Cuba
This was enough to tempt Isabel to visit

The original founders of the text message believed that a short message is more than enough to concisely describe what they want to say. The saying ""time is money"" is consistent with the idea of text messages because it is faster and easier than making a phone call or meeting someone face to face. The negative sides of text messages, however, are that they may be allowing our attention spans to decrease because of the instantaneous send and response.

- The barn owl relies on horizontal and vertical dimensions to capture prey. 
- The barn owl and humans have the same azimuth, but humans are 3x worse at vertical dimensions. 
- The barn owl is very sensitive to subtle changes in its prey. This can be shown through the realignment of the talons. 
- The barn owl's face is the most striking feature. 
- The feathers on the owl's face are significant to the owl's hearing. They act as outer ear canals for the owl by funneling in sound. 
- The barn owl uses differences in timing between its right and left ears to determine how far the prey is.

He consulted the National Zoo in DC on their new panda exhibit in 2006. 
- Dr. Wang acknowledges critics when they say that the focus on pandas in zoos takes away from the real culprits of panda endangerment. That is why the National Zoo now has decision stations for visitors to look at. These are Dr. Wang's favorite part of the exhibit since they help visitors understand why the panda problem cannot only be solved by biologists. 
- Pandas represent yin and yang in Chinese culture. To Dr. Wang, they represent a balance between research on pandas and wildlife conservation. 
- Research on pandas may take away from research on other endangered species, such as snow leopards. But panda research can also help create wildlife corridors, which have been compared to rivers. 
- Dr. Wang was happy when a mother panda trusted him to take care of her cub. She had become used to him following her around.

Aunt Viv was someone that the narrator enjoyed spending time with because her house was calm. At this funeral, the narrator sees Reena and begins to recall their adolescence together. Reena's confidence at the funeral reminds the narrator of how she was in her adolescence. The narrator recalls that on her 12th birthday, Reena decided to change her name from her given name (Doreen) to Reena. After this, Reena refused to answer to ""Doreen"" and reinforced her new name by staring at people until they said her chosen name and pointing threateningly at them. The narrator also describes how in adolescence, it seemed like Reena was far ahead of her developmentally. Instead of having to navigate the ""rough edges"" of adolescence, Reena seemed to have jumped straight into adulthood. She was worldly and would discuss issues like Hitler's invasion of Poland, the Civil War in Spain, and lynchings in the South, which contrasted with the narrator's childish interests. In addition, Reena was a confident and commanding child who even intimidated her own father. He didn't seem to know how to treat her, so would give her space. In contrast, her mother would alternate between being very strict and being permissive, but her mother's parenting style seemed to work better for Reena.

Non-parametric measures are used when the sample of interest does not follow a normal distribution. In addition, hypothesis testing can involve diagnostic tests which are used to measure the accuracy of the model. These tests work by evaluating the randomness of the calculated error in the test.

So even if the format of that passage was newer for me, it definitely aided in remembering information. ","I have had positive experiences with both typical straight line text formats and diagrams. As aforementioned, diagrams are particularly helpful for studying large amounts of or complex information in order to see how it all connects. However, if I want to read a lot of information in a short period of time and just take notes on it, passage two would be more helpful. "

The main argument is that it is more time efficient and anything that can be said face to face can easily be said over text to save time and energy. The author also wrote about a con to this idea and how one argues that facial interactions and human expressions are lost over text. This loses the deeper meanings and interactions we have with people. The author then circles back to how this point is missing the idea that efficiency is key and people will text rather than meet up with someone for particular interactions.

The argument is that people do not always need these interactions if it means sending efficient messages to people. While human interactions are left out, people are able to communicate so much easier and are able to get very close to each other via the phone.

Later in the passage, her son begs her to visit him in Miami (his home) but the mother declines. The son tempts her with the promise of a ballet performance. She responds that the dancers in Cuba are better than the dancers in Miami. The son explains that this dancer was originally from their home country, but she had to leave due to the strict political climate. He states that the mother will be unable to watch this dancer perform unless she visits him. The mother concedes and thoroughly enjoys the performance.

It was less paragraphs and more relationships between concepts. In terms of organizing literature based in science and math, Passage 2 was much easier to read. If Passage 2 was organized in traditional paragraphs, it would have been very hard to read. This would not be the case for Passage 1.",This format was easier to read because of the content and structure. The content is a narrative so it is easier to read and follow along.

When all the details were split up it was much easier to find the information because I was able to use the signposts to efficiently go to the section I needed to look at. However, having so many hyperlinks made the information hard to keep track of. I found myself wasting more time looking for specific information. When answering the question for passage 2, I was able to scan the whole map, locate details for all the questions, and come back to each section when it was applicable. This meant that I skipped over more information in paragraph 2, and did not grasp the information as thoroughly.","I remember far more details about the first passage. This is not simply because it was easier to read, but it forced me to follow a more detailed flow of information in order to answer the question. It is just like going through a maze. You may find the correct path immediately, or you will have to run into several dead ends first. Although the dead ends do not directly get you the answer, it narrows your search for alternative roughts. I had to take the wrong path several times before I was able to find the answer and in turn I was able to learn much more information. I am also someone who highly benefits from intricate mind-maps because my thoughts tend to get confused in my head. I like having everything separated for me.","Personally, I tend to easily mix up information when it is presented in a larger paragraph. I will misinterpret information and make mistakes on questions that could have been easily prevented. In a passage like #1, I was easily able to mentally compartmentalize each piece of information. I would not confuse the Mother and Father's role in Reena's life, for example. I almost messed up several questions in passage 2 because I misread what graphs were good and which were bad for a certain purpose. When everything is written to emulate the way we think about the information it is easier to understand. Although there were far more buttons and pages to keep track of, I was still able to comprehend it more easily. This also may have a lot to do with my familiarity with the subjects. I do not know much about managerial decision making so it was harder to remember. "

The mind-map itself felt like a visual representation of the inner workings of my brain. I did not have to spend any time mapping all the information myself. For example, I was able to easily separate the roles each parent played in the protagonist's life because the information was kept separate. Passage 2, on the other hand, was much easier to navigate. Thanks to the headers in each bubble, I was able to find the passage that contained the information I needed very easily. I like to create mind-maps like this when I am studying for a test. However, there were some times when I mixed up small details in the paragraph such as similar words or lists. If I had not gone back to check my work I would have missed a careless mistake. In short, I prefer passage 1 but find passage 2 to be a very good, more efficient, alternative.","As I explained in the previous question, I found passage 1 to be much more efficient. Although there were far more buttons I had to push and navigate in order to get the answer, I still found the passage much easier to understand. Infact, having to work harder and remember where all the information was helped me remember the information more. When I was looking for the answer to one question, I would collect details along the way. When I saw another question that refers to the information I had previously seen, I needed to use active recall to find it again. Again, this also can be attributed to the way that I personally work best. I can see why paragraph 1 can be very disorienting or confusing for some people. All the mind maps are hard to keep track of.","Although my scores on the written response were fairly low, I can say pretty confidently that I still have a pretty good grasp of paragraph 1. I remember all the side characters and what their relationships were to the narrator. On the other hand, I do not remember any big-picture takeaways from the second passage. This reminds me of the way I feel when I try to use a textbook when studying for a test. I cannot remember small details when reading large chunks of text. It is when I take the time to create a mind-map similar to passage 1 that I feel prepared to recall the material.  "

Matters like evolution of animals are discussed and taught to children from a young age, so people are able to reason with this type of content more, whereas statistics tends to be taught at higher levels of education, so audiences are less familiar with this content. Second, passage #2 used much less words, which made the passage seem less overwhelming and made it easier to navigate, especially when skimming over and trying to find specific sections after reading once. Because the first passage had much longer blocks of text, it was more difficult to remember which piece of information came from which text block.","Passage 2 was easier to go through because the way it was mapped out allowed the reader to create connections between all of the pieces of information more easily and keep it organized in the reader's mind. It was also helpful to take in smaller chunks of information at once, whereas Passage 1 consisted of large paragraphs that made all of the information mesh together in the reader's mind if they only read it once. The content of Passage 2 was also easier to understand; animal evolution is taught to youth from a young age, whereas the statistical analyses content from Passage 1 is content that less people are familiar with and have iterated to them less throughout life, so this made Passage 1 more difficult to follow as well as intimidating while reading.

Therefore, the design of the second passage is more effective because of how it breaks apart the information into much smaller sections. It was also helpful to have the first page of the second passage that, to some extent, served as 7 different headers for the reader to direct themselves back to and that were more clear in the content they contained than the headers in the first passage. All of the headers in the first passage had a multitude of topics they each seemed to touch on, but the ""headers"" in the second passage were more specific. Being able to click on each of these ""headers"" individually in the second passage somehow made it easier to navigate than the headers of the first passage, yet I am not entirely certain why. ","Both of these passages had two vary drastic representations of flow charts, and a flow chart these is in-between the designs of Passage 1 and Passage 2 would be ideal. As previously stated, Passage 1 was very information packed with longer paragraphs. Passage 2 had the information divided up more which made it easier for the reader to digest, yet since it was broken down into such few words in every place this also made it difficult to follow and form complete sentences in the reader's head. Dividing the information into multiple pages in Passage 2 also made it easier to separate topics in the reader's mind, yet Passage 1 had the advantage of having all of the information laid out in one place for the reader to quickly sift through and reference back towards. ","I think a combination of both formats would be most effective. Passage 1 was almost too text heavy with long paragraphs that could have been separated a bit more to help the reader mentally categorize all of the information a bit more. As previously stated, Passage 2 broke up the information a bit too much and sometimes made it difficult to follow through a full sentence or point when navigating the article. Passage 2 still helped to serve the purpose of an information web, or flow chart, because the reader was able to see how all of this information connected to one another, whereas reading Passage 1 felt like reading a textbook with paragraphs that were just scattered rather than in a uniform format.

Concentrating too much funds on captive panda breeding would be somewhat wasteful as it wouldn't conquer the true roots of the issue; real-world habitat destruction. It may be beneficial to allocate funding toward habitat protection.

Wildlife corridors are a method of habitat conservation that serve to bridge little patches of still-existing habitats, which encourages habitat revitalization and a potential boost in animal population.

There were several correlations of the new panda exhibit to Dr. Wan's previous research.

Dr. Wan spent a lot of time with a mother panda, and was excited when the panda left him the responsibility of caring for her cub.

Pandas are highly symbolic in China, especially for politics and diplomacy, as they were utilized as gifts and symbols of peace.

The new exhibit was going to replicate features of an actual panda habitat, and would include things like cooling rocks and panda grottos. 

There were many critics that attacked the amount of funding being allocated to captive panda breeding because it didn't really pinpoint the true issue; the destruction of panda habitats in the wild.

Pandas are very symbolically significant in China. The black and white fur symbolizes yin and yang, and pandas were symbols of peace and diplomacy several times in Chinese history.

The new zoo exhibit was relevant to Dr. Wan's research. 

Dr. Wan once connected with a mother panda so well that the panda allowed him to take care of her cub unattended.

","I think the way that the first passage was broken into little chunks made it much easier to follow the information. when i was reading the second passage, i often got lost in the big paragraphs of information, but the format of the first passage made it easy to follow along, retain multiple ideas (because one concept branched into numerous, comparable concepts), and even go backwards if I needed to.

However, I think that my responses are a little biased because the content of the first passage was far more interesting to me, and I was more engaged with the material. That being said, the concept of breaking up a large passage into small pieces like in the first passage is something that I do personally to retain information better. When it is broken up, it is less daunting to approach the text, and it is easy to follow what the author is trying to convey. I also like that in the format of passage 1, you can go backwards to retrace a thought, or you can start in the middle of a ""sentence"" or flow of text in order to find an idea that you are searching for.

Another point described in the passage was that of defending nests against intruders; in such a scenario, the ant would strike the intruder (which would have to be around the same size as the ant) on its side with its jaw to make it land outside of the nest, the action of which would also make the ant jump outside the nest.

More generally, I feel that the format of Passage 1 may be best for retaining knowledge, due to its concise and simple structure, but I still feel that the structure of Passage 2 is more conducive to establishing or associating semantic meaning with the text, though again that may be due to personal experience of having read texts that are consecutively long (like the format of Passage 2).","The use of either knowledge representation format is situational and depends on the exact purpose I need: if I might need to remember historical/factual/objective information (such as from a psychology/biology textbook) for an upcoming assessment/presentation, then I think the format of Passage 1 is best.

The conservationist is particularly fond of pandas - he became popular on the internet for being trusted by a mother panda.

If I were to practice passage 1 mapping more often I think it could be equally if not more so effective for learning and retention. However, familiarity with passage 2 mapping was most beneficial to my learning.  ","I think both representation formats have their merits, in that they are beneficial for either type of subject matter. My memory of fiction tends to be better than that of nonfiction which may have impacted this in some regards. However, I can see how representing in both ways can be effective. For passage 1, having to struggle with how to even read the chart forced me to slow down and truly comprehend the information before answering the questions. The more straightforward but larger text in passage 2 I see as slightly more accessible for students because it is familiar to them. ","Both passages have their merit, I think after seeing my scores I was not entirely surprised by the results in that I do have better free recall in regards to fictional stories but do better on nonfiction when there are prompted questions given. I see that both passages have had their advantages in terms of my memories of the readings. Since the prima ballerina had an emphasis on the chronological order of events made free recall easier, also because the format forced me to have to comprehend the nature of events. For the jaws that jump however it became easier to search and find specific words which indicated an answer.

- The ""Now, this"" model of television, which primes viewers to consume another short, compressed piece of news, which is unrelated to the topic preceding it. As a result of this model, viewers become desensitized to the severity of the tragedies that they consume. Generally, these segments are extremely short. 
- The role of appearance is also extremely important in how viewers perceive the credibility of their news, wherein more attractive faces are more likely to generate positive reactions. This was well-exhibited by the case of one female newscaster (Christine) who was fired after being hired at a news station, as viewers responded poorly to her appearance. In response, she sued the station. 
- The phenomenon of ""talking hairdos"" is also common, which refers to the prioritization of the appearance of newscasters over their words/the news that they are sharing.

Their jaw allowed them to catch prey and successfully beat the defense systems of their prey as well. Their powerful jaws were due to the fact that they stored energy in their muscles and are able to release the energy when chomping down. In order to protect themselves from their own jaw, the jaws are able to slow down right before closure so the two halves of the jaw don't clash into each other. These jaws also allowed them to have 2 different defensive strategies. One of the strategies allowed the ants to, lining themselves up perpendicular to the ground, launch off of the ground and jump to higher ground in order to escape or attack their enemy at a different location. This would also cause confusion for their enemy.

There was less information to read through. However, I do think that it is nice to have all the information on one page to skim through, like passage 1 did.

I would have to remember exactly which link the information I want was in, in order to be efficient. The format was also sometimes distracting and I found myself looking back on what I had just read, more often than I did during passage 1. Since passage 1 was all formatted in one page in separate paragraphs, while more concentration may be required to answer the questions, it was easier to find the information efficiently. The paragraphs all had headers and not much prowling around was required to find the area of information relevant to the question.

As learning the main ideas and the details around the main points is more important for academic learning, both representation formats are helpful as I was able to retain that goal from both passages. I think it mainly depends on the learning types of individuals. For example, the format for passage 2 may be better for visual learners than passage 1.

Therefore, I don't really have a good idea about what that whole page was about in general. However, for passage 1, I felt that I had a greater idea about what the paragraphs talked about and had more informational descriptions than insightful (passage 2). Even for the passage 2 multiple-choice questions, I still struggle to answer the question about what the passage discusses in relation to Dr. Wang's works and the zoo because the information is too vague to hone in on a specific answer.

The second one might be more useful in certain circumstances, like if you're already very familiar with the concepts (for instance, if you already know what diagnostic tests entail, you could very quickly move to that box instead of navigating through the huge web), but overall the first one often splits up information in a way that is very manageable. ","I think passage 1 is easier if I'm trying to grasp something new, while 2 would be easier if I already know the material. This is because 1 is spread out and easy to follow, but kind of hard to individually process/recall, likely exactly because it is spread out in a long flow chart. 2 has information condensed densely, but the information is still based on associations. If I need to review error concepts, I can quickly go to the diagnostic tests section and get what I need immediately, because I already know what they are and how they related."

The reliability of any given news story is placed most heavily on the way a newscaster looks rather than the verification of its sources - hence the nickname ""talking hairdos"" for anchors. The commodification of airtime has also limited the amount of time and energy the public spends on any given story. If there's more money in one story but not another, it will likely be given more airtime. The phrase ""Now this"" forces viewers to stop thinking about one story and immediately switch to another, as the phrase implies no connection between the story just presented and the one that's immediately going to follow. The example of Christine Craft shows us the drawbacks of placing importance on newscaster appearance, as well as highlighting sexism in the field.

""Now this"" indicates a digression from one story to another where the two don't connect at all. Not to mention the reliability/veracity of a story is based on the newscaster's appearance rather than their sources (hence the nickname ""talking hairdos""). Commodification of airtime has also made presenting news stories about money and entertainment rather than the transmission of information. The example of Christine Craft shows us not only the sexism prevalent in broadcast news but also how appearance is the only thing that matters. Craft was originally hired in the 80s because of her looks and not even a year later she was fired for the same reason since she wasn't popular with viewers.

Passage 1 may have been really spread out and hard to follow sometimes, but the boxes of each fact basically turned it into a bullet note summation without the bullet notes. Passage 2 was a pretty standard flow chart, with everything condensed into the proper sections. 
Aside from the typos and grammar errors in both passages, I was able to get a sense of what was happening in both without too much struggle.","As I said before, Passage 2 was easier to read which meant that the information was able to stick better (especially for the first round of testing). However, being quizzed again today, I was surprised to find that I was able to recall the information in Passage 1 slightly faster than in Passage 2. This might be because I have a very good visual memory so when I pull up the ""files"" of information, I see where it was on the page rather than simply just remembering it. The unique format of Passage 1 allowed me to more quickly pull that image back up than in Passage 2. ",My scores stayed the most consistent with Passage 2's knowledge representation. The drop between the 2nd and 3rd sessions was much less than seen in Passage 1.

The first passage was formatted in a way that was highly divided up and made connecting the ideas more basic, but also made it a bit more tedious and messy. The second format was helpful in showing the main idea of the story and hoe each topic branched off of that main idea, with respective details under each idea. For myself, I would say that the formatting of the second passage was much more efficient and easier to interpret. ","Passage 2 was, in my opinion, much easier to read as there was more lengthy paragraphs that directly flowed into one another.

I believe this because the learner in this case is forced to process information in connective bits rather than lengthy, descriptive chunks. It is often times hard to learn through theoretically swallowing lots of information and is rather easier to take things step by step in order to remember relevant details. For example, when learning a song on an instrument, you practice the notes first and then run through the song. You don't run through the song and hope that each note is remembered or known prior to attempting them. Similarly, reading in chunks and hoping to remember the small details or connections within them is often hard to do because there are lots of words and descriptions within the sentences that may not always be remembered by the learner. Thus, I believe the formatting of passage 1 is more helpful for academic learning, including my own. ","Like I said, I believe that passage 2 was easier to read due to the fluidity of the words and passage 1 was easier to interpret, forging better academic learning. I believe this to be true because the information was divided into its most simplest form, where the reader actively had to put in work to interpret the connection between each word/idea/component of the story. As a result of having to put in this work to connect simple components of a sentence, the reader thus had to insert more effort into processing a single entity, which overall is more conducive to better memory of things and increased academic learning. ","I change my answer for this question based on seeing my scores. I believe that the formatting for passage 2 was more beneficial to my own academic learning because of the chunks of text that it included. The first passage was more divided up and spread out, so retaining quantity was much less likely than it is for the formatting of passage 2. Since the questions were shown with the text, I found myself not reading through every single small box in the story as I simply observed the answers to the questions and moved on. As for the formatting of passage 2, I had to read through every bit of information in order to learn more and find more answers to the questions. For that, I absorbed more information throughout the passage than I did with passage 1. "

While both formats had links to big idea nodes that made it easier to summarize and memorize the passages, I preferred the organization of #2 because the links were smoother to navigate, divided themes up into clusters, and being able to zoom out and look at each theme in the main diagram helped me to connect ideas much more efficiently.","The second passage was the easiest to work through visually and condensed information into small but meaningful enough chunks so that ideas flowed naturally in the chart. This format made it easier to create a memory pathway in my mind that I could work backwards from. My initial score for passage two was a 4/9 but after reading the themes at the top of each link and memorizing key details, it was easy to understand the overall meaning of the passage. The first representation format is effective too, but it was harder to remember important takeaways within the larger walls of text, so I had to go back and reread sections a few times, which may have disrupted my chronological encoding of information.

When I sit down to read a passage, sometimes I reach the bottom of the page before I realize I didn't take the time to comprehend the words I just passed over. By using a knowledge representation format, the most important takeaways and facts are organized and emphasized, limiting the amount of mental summarization or note-taking that must take place to reinforce the content through restudying and re-reading it. ","Both representations are helpful to learning because they structure the content and use nodes to highlight main takeaways as well as linking verbs or phrases to connect the dots and chain information explicitly with a visual aid. While it was easier to remember information with format # 2, sometimes the way it constantly branched off made it confusing to read and harder to remember chronologically, although it made recall easier. On the other hand, format #1 was easier for initial learning and followed a sequence that made more intuitive sense. Both made summarization much more accessible and I would incorporate either technique into studying, but for different purposes: one for encoding and one for recall.","As shown by the test scores as well as the ease of recall after having spent a week away from the passages, representation #2 was the better performer. The quizzes tested my ability to pick apart key details, and the ""flowchart"" style of #2 made it easier to create mental images and sift through other nodes at will as opposed to format #1, which felt more like traditional reading. While #1 still divided content into meaningful strands, #2 felt more focused with links separated by theme.

The author explains the culture significance of text messages in many forms of entertainment, and provides evidence to support the claim that text messages are a efficient, time-saving form of communication. The author also points out critics of text messaging, who claim that is it erasing the human experience of meaningfully connecting with others, but points how its similarities to writing letters and other historic forms of communication that have been deemed incredibly useful then and now as we use those documentations to learn about human history. Finally, the author expresses the idea that text messaging allows us to interact with much more people than our ancestors every could, and provides a form of connection that may not be as good as the real thing, but is certainly a valuable asset.

First, the author points out that because of the limited attention span of viewers and structure of TV programming, news segments are broken down into small chunks that are not connected to each other, and that do not allow a careful explanation of the details of the story or the viewers to put any critical thought into digesting them. The author explains that TV news does not have merit in any useful journalist way, but has become another form of entertainment and does not hold any value beyond that. Additionally, the author explains how unreliable the news is, as the goal of TV news is to hire the most attractive people that appear the most ""credible"" at face value and therefore dictate what information viewers believe and what they do not trust. Finally, the author cites an example of a female newscaster who filed a lawsuit against a TV news station as she was fired based on her appearance. The author uses this example of this newscaster being fired because her appearance did not make her look ""credible"" enough to viewers to justify their claim that the truth is TV news is fabricated ",,c,b,a,b,d,a,c,a,d,,Wed Mar 09 2022 09:25:49 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time),9,1,306,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,K2,Wed Mar 09 2022 09:29:34 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time),Wed Mar 09 2022 09:25:56 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time),,,,,,,I felt Passage 1 was more helpful for academic learning because it had the text broken up into more indiviual sections which allowed for short blocks of information to be easily accessible when asked to recall specific components of the text. ,,,,

It mainly argued that the news as presented on T.V. has become merely a form of entertainment, where serious subjects are not treated with respect. The author embodies this with the commonly used T.V. phrase ""Now.. This"", which is used by television show hosts to introduce new topics rapidly, that have nothing to do with previous topics. This rapid changing of topics is due to limited air time, and causes viewers to not pay as much attention and deeply think about what was just presented. The author also talks about how many television news hosts are only picked for their perceived attractiveness and credibility.

If they can keep viewers, they can keep the job basically. This lead one woman to suing  the television network she worked for, believing they fired her for not fitting their standards for a female host. The author argues that this presentation of television news devalues the actual news, and takes away seriousness from serious matters. The author brings up the phrase ""Now.. this"" which is a common T.V. phrase used to quickly transition from one topic to the next.

This quick changing from topic to topic, devalues each topic in specific, and makes it harder for the viewer to take the news seriously. What the viewer does take seriously, argues the author, is the perceived attractiveness and credibility of the reporter. Thus, T.V. networks try to chooses the most attractive well-spoken people to present the news, not those who could actually present the news in the most accurate and meaningful way. This led to a lawsuit in one case, where a woman sued the T.V. network she worked for, claiming they fired her for sexist reasons.

For example, for passage 1's format, it may have been quicker to help identify the information needed by being able to point out the key word or phrase needed.

On the other hand, in passage 2, I felt as if I gained more context because of the paragraph format that helped me gain a bigger picture meaning. "

As said before, I am a slow reading so Passage 2 only had the important words necessary to convey the message across. Also, I retain information better through kinesthetic learning and enjoy interactive methods help me in making learning better.","The web map structure was easier for me personally to follow. Less word cluttering and intuitive flow chart type format to reveal main points. The first page of the passage had an even smaller web map containing the main ideas with a link to each section of the passage, a much more complex web map but easier to read than a passage. Overall, is well organized and easy to follow when reading. "

The knowledge representation of passage 2 was divided into smaller paragraphs with clear titles. This was helpful in locating the paragraph I wanted. I would then scan read the paragraph for the information I wanted, this meant I may have read some information I did not want but I also did this in passage 1  as it took slightly longer to locate the area on the tree that I wanted.

The passage describes how having immense jaw strength leads to advantage in the wild

- Firstly, the jaws are the fastest in the world meaning attacking prey is easy for these ants. However, the ants never harm themselves as the speed decelerates quickly. The jaw is able to move so quickly due to a store up of energy in the ants muscles.

- Secondly, the sheer speed of the jaws gives the ants jumping skills. They can either jump from defense or attack. When an attacking ant enters the nest, the home ant attacks and flings the attacking ant in the opposite direction and sends itself in the other. The ant often lands in a position to be able to launch a new attack.  Sometimes the ant will simply jump to flee a situation by jumping away, this is a behaviour that may have originally been formed accidently.

This strength comes from the build up of energy in the muscles of the jaw but the ants never hurt themselves as the mandibles decrease very quickly.

However, the jaws can also be used for jumping abilities. The strength of the jaw means that the ants can jump to flee when they are being attacked (this may have been an initial behavorial accident) or when they are attacking another ant. When an attacking ant enters the nest, the ant flings the attacking ant out of the nest and it thus gets flinged in the opposite direction.

I would use the knowledge representation for passage 2 for literature (or other humanities). This is because it is an effective way to summarise certain chapters, events or devices. I believe, in fact, that passage 1 should have used knowledge representation 2 and passage 2 should have used knowledge representation 1.

Due to the success of this method, it was repeated, which caused a new mechanism of self-protection in future ants. The power of the jaw comes from energy stored in the mandible. However, the mandible will decelerate before closing, preventing the ant from being harmed.

The jaw of these ants is very powerful, with the strong force enabling them to bite through the thick shells of their prey. This jump mechanism not only pushes the ant out of danger, but can push a predator out of the ants nest, as well. When used for hunting, the ant can also propel themselves to a new vantage point, allowing a secondary attack.

The author points out that one of the main reasons of it is controversial is how difficult it is to convey emotional meaning or tone within words of a message. This makes messaging to people feel less alive but despite that, having text messaging gives a recollection of the events of conversing with someone and that can be special to look back to.

One of the key points that were indicated by the author was through a critique that mentioned how text messages did not express any feelings or tone which removed that extra sense of communicating with someone. Despite this criticism, the author does point out that text messaging has a history feature where anyone that has not deleted their messages can go back anytime to look back at past conversations, making these occurrences endless in a way. Having text messages not only is great for keeping a history of what you have talked about, but it is also quick and easy compared to conversations made in person.

While there are some great points of using text messaging such as its convenience of time, it has a drawback when it comes to expressing emotions or emitting tone through the messages. They lack what can be seen in-person communication as we look at a person's face to determine their mood and reactions to whatever they are listening to. Despite this negative, the author does point out the positives of text messaging as a medium of communication as it can be used as a way to go back to past messages like a memoir of events that occurred. It is significant enough to have conversations kept in storage so that someone can go back to that conversation and reminese ",,d,a,b,d,d,d,d,d,c,b,Fri Jun 10 2022 11:44:50 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),7,0.7,192,H2,Fri Jun 03 2022 11:33:59 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),Fri Jun 03 2022 11:24:40 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),H2,Mon Jun 06 2022 12:07:49 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),,H2,Fri Jun 10 2022 12:07:27 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),Fri Jun 10 2022 11:52:44 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),"Out of the two passages, the structure that was most easiest to read and understand was passage 1. Passage 1 contained all the information that was required for a reader to know what the author’s message was in the passage such as texting being a global medium of communication but also being very controversial. Each box within passage 1 had a paragraph giving enough details of what it was based on its topic title above the box and by reading from left to right and top to bottom, I was also able to answer the questions since each box gave enough information to justify my answer choice. Passage 1s’ boxes’ branch accordingly to its topic title and the message it was conveying which helped me answer the questions. The structure reminded me of a more infographic type of style being presented for this passage. Each box gives a sweet spot between have a load of information and too little information to understand the message behind the box. 

Passage 2 on the other hand felt a bit harder for me to understand the author’s message to the reader as I was going through multiple boxes and seeing if there were any key words that I should take out of it. Each box only contained a single word and so it makes it difficult for me to maintain focus on what the passage was talking about as I am constantly looking at one box to another to get all the details of what this whole slide was talking about. There is a lot of visual clutter that prevented me to focus as I am constantly thinking maybe I am looking at the wrong path of boxes laid out to me to answer the questions. I did however liked the presentation as having links to divide the passage into sections helped me understand what topic I am on. Having a sentence or two in each box while reducing the number of boxes in this passage would make me understand it more I think. ","Passage 1 was easier to read because of how there was enough information packed in a single box to where I can understand what each box was talking about and their main points so that I can answer each question. Reading from left to right and top to bottom was much clear to understand and it fit the flow of reading as I had an idea where the beginning was and where the end was at. I did not get lost while trying to find where I needed to read next and that helped with me understanding what the passage was talking about. 

Passage 2 on the other hand seemed to branch out way too much with a couple of words on each box. Having to read every box and line just to get to the point of something takes too many visual disturbances as I have having to move my eye to locate the next box while figuring out if I was reading on the right path.  It took me multiple times to read each section of passage two when it was unnecessary as the number of boxes can be greatly reduced to explain the same exact information with a few sentences rather than a couple of words and having to look at more boxes to get more information. ","Even after attending three sessions, I do think the first passage had the easier format to read through as it presented its information all in a box. I was able to answer the questions without having to think about where I would think which box would help me answer the question. Reading from left to right and top to bottom was easy to see and navigate as I was able to know where to start and where to end. It makes reading and understanding what it is about much more significant when it comes to learning and being tested on what I learned.

The second passage had too many boxes that contained only a few words each and so it made it harder to process the information while reading it as I had to constantly move my eyes to the next box while also making sure that the next box, I read fluidly fits what I am reading about. While it does branch out and connects multiple boxes, it is hard at least for me to process that information as I am also looking at boxes at my periphery. Distractors are more noticeable when you use your periphery vision especially when you are moving your eyes. The vision distraction did make it take longer to understand and answer the questions overall.  "

Since each news topic is covered for a couple of minutes at a time, it lacks the reinforcement a person requires to digest the information and learn about what happened or even have an emotional connection to what is going on even though people are altruistic in nature. There is also a negative side to how newscasters are chosen and it is not entirely based on their credibility with presenting news, but rather on how physically attractive they are.

Since news segments are divided into 90-second chunks, there is little time to process information into the brain that creates meaning and emphasis. By the time another story is presented, the previous news story quickly becomes something of the past making it less important now since at the moment, whatever is being said now is the main focus. There is also problems with the picks of broadcasters themselves since they are chosen not by their resume, but rather their physical attraction.

When it comes to delivering the news, each topic goes over a story for only 90 seconds, lacking the amount of time to fully digest and comprehend what the story is about as well as be able to build a connection to the story. There is also a lack of trust when it comes to the newscasters as they are seen as illegitimate to present news to the public as they are chosen based on their physical looks. While they may be qualified for the role as a newscaster, the viewers see it as a distractor, making it unsatisfactory to them to fully focus on the news even if the newscaster is communicating their stories accurately.

I think that the balance between the 2 structures would help my academic learning. Having the option to choose between these 2 structures can also be beneficial since structure 1 seems to provide a lot more detail and so I would think that would be more useful in a setting where you want to critically study and understanding what you are learning while in the structure of passage 2 can be used for quick sessions to review or something to learn something in short sessions.","While it did seem like I prefer passage 1 as it was easier to read, I can see passage 2 as an effective way to study and learn since it provides information quickly to some extent by reducing the number of words in each box. I can see passage 1's structure as more of a lesson/study session where a student can go more in detail learning about something while for passage 2, that can be for someone that needs a quick recap of what they learned on a certain topic. I think that if you add a sentence of two in passage 2's structure rather than a couple words in each box can make it a better way to access quick information as it can reduce the visual clutter and needing multiple boxes to give the point across. Combining both passage structures seems to be really beneficial as well for academic learning if that is another option too. But I can see how both structures can be helpful for in-depth learning as well as quick learning.","While my scores on the written response are super low, I can still see it benefitting when it comes to learning from both passage formats given how my multiple-choice scores are relatively okay. The first passage structure can be used on studying in-depth as it contains more information on each box like an infographic, just without the images. Someone can use these knowledge formats to take their time to learn and process that information with the details that it has with each box and how it is branched out. The second passage can be beneficial in learning for quick sessions or to use as a reminding boost to the information that has been learned previously. Since boxes contain less content compared to the first passage, that can be used to practice memorizing the information. I think making a sentence or two for each of the boxes in the second passage structure while reducing the number of boxes can make the whole reading and comprehension process easier for someone that wants to learn in quick sessions and for others that want to practice what they already know and such.

- Their were two particular jumps, one which propelled both the ant and the intruder out of the nest, and another which occurred when a predator/researcher approached that was essentially a frenzy of jumping and biting

When answering the questions, I found myself visualizing the map in my mind to remember the information. ","Passage one is more helpful, especially for studying because it gives you exactly what you need - nothing more nothing less. It helps me remember key points with ease and I usually struggle remembering things from a reading the first time around. If I were to use passage two to study, I would need to highlight certain parts to remember key points.","Again, passage one is more helpful for my academic learning because it provides only the key bits of information and leaves out anything extraneous. It has a similar effect to using a highlighter which is helpful for going back and studying. "

The high style of the architecture with a shiny floor and spacious interiors made her feel uncomfortable because she did not believe she belonged there.
When she got older, one day, her child Alejandro bought a ticket for them to see a Russian ballet dancer who defected from the Soviet Union.  When Isabel saw the ticket, she was so excited and surpised.  By seeing that, her son Alejandro knew that his mother has always wanted to realize her dream of becoming a professional ballet dancer.  It might be just that she missed her chance or circumstances didn't allow her to do so.",,c,d,d,d,b,b,a,a,c,a,Fri Mar 25 2022 13:31:28 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),5,0.5,554,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,H2,Fri Mar 25 2022 13:37:22 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),Fri Mar 25 2022 13:32:54 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),,,,,,,"Passage 2 has too many branches that I think I will get confused if I try to look back to my notes and find a certain concept or key word.

","Although I found the second passage easier to understand, I find that both passages can be beneficial to learning, depending on the the subject or topic at hand. I was clearly able to learn better through the second passage, but I wonder if that would be the same case if the two passages were the same but in flipped formats - so, if the Managerial Decision Making passage was laid out more as a story, would I have been able to remember more or is is the specific topic that I struggled with? Regardless, I find it helpful to use different types and ways to get the most out of your academic learning. ","I also believe having several different formats of learning can help you gain information and expand your learning capacity in ways that are very helpful. Depending on the topic, something that is more straightforward and direct, such as the web maps, could be more useful, but for another topic that may require more detail, the second passage format could be helpful.

Also, news is for pure entertainment rather than for credible information sharing, and that's why news anchors are judged so harshly on their appearance. Looking good results in being viewed as having more credibility-- having ""eyes too close together"" or being ""ugly"" reduces credibility and makes viewers not want to watch, but the key goal of the news is to gain the largest audience possible.

Having everything on one page though was nice instead of jumping around. I think both could be beneficial in learning. ,"Based on my test scores I would say that passage 1 was more helpful when the information was right in front of me to move through the different sections.

In other words, I appreciate the paragraphs as they give me content, explanations, and examples all in one scan — compared to Passage 1 where I would have to look around for points. Other than that, I also prefer reading somewhat 'dense' paragraphs because it helps better my understanding in a topic.

Although Passage 2 was more condensed with information, it helped in my understanding of the topic much more as compared to in Passage 1. In my opinion, Passage 2 had a lot more 'flow' in its storytelling which I prefer and I believe is much more beneficial in terms of academic learning. Passage 1's representation format would help me more in refreshing my memory and in terms of revision as it less condensed and uses short key terms to get information across to the reader.","I believe Passage 2 was helpful for my academic learning more so than Passage 1. Although I did not score any much higher than I did in the first passage (perhaps even lower), I still think presenting the information in a 'story-telling' essay format made it easier to understand. Personally, I would rather understand a concept compared to just remembering key points as presented in Passage 1. In the long run, I believe I will remember more of Passage 2 than I ever will Passage 1. Either way, Passage 1 is ideal whenever I would like to revise the topic because the short and simple mind maps help refresh the knowledge I have learnt."

The jumping function, also propelled by the ants' jaw, may, according to some scientists who specialize in the study of this species, have evolved through accidental behavior such as banging the head to the ground.

The first passage, while it was visually more interesting to look at, was hard to follow because the sentences that were formed from individual words were at times incoherent or were just too long to actually make sense. The structure of the information was still really helpful, but it was hard to understand some of it. Additionally, some of the branches of information in passage 1 were extremely large, which was overwhelming. The paragraphs in passage 2 were much easier to understand, as the paragraph had all the information you needed about a given topic. The sentences were complete, and it felt like information was easier to remember when I was reading it in the traditional reading method; the sentences were already made for me rather than me making my own sentences. ","Passage 2 was easier to read because it was done in a format that I am used to. I have frequently seen passages formatted in boxes with arrows with large amounts of text being inside the boxes. However, I have never seen a passage which had boxes that only had a few or single words in it. This caused it to be harder for me to read, as I had to get used to a new format, but also that I had to make my own pathway in reading the sentences, whereas in passage 2, the sentences were already phrased for me.","I am used to seeing passages in the format of Passage 2 (large bulk of text, such as articles, textbooks, and more!). Therefore, I didn't need to spend time to get used to a new format of passage. With Passage 1, it was hard for me to adjust to the new format that I have never really used before, and also reading some of the sentences was really challenging as the sentences that I formed from the flow chart seemed to be really long and at times impossible to follow and understand."

The barn owl also has extremely sensitive sound intensity and loudness to determine the location of the pray (louder sound in the right ear than the left ear means the pray is on the right of the bird). It was pointed out that sound localization plays a role in the organization of a barn owl's brain, as the neurons that are near each other usually respond to the same region of where the sound is coming from.

The barn owl has remarkable hearing, and while its horizontal hearing is about the same as that of a person, its vertical hearing is three times as impressive.

Additionally, the owl uses its hearing to hunt and the extreme specifics of its hearing can be seen when an owl is hunting and releases its talons to catch a prey because the sound works to help the owl hunt.

I was really struggling with figuring out how to go about understanding the knowledge from passage 1, so it was really nice to read passage 2 and immediately understand where to go with the information. Since passage 1 was in a format I wasn't used to, I was under pressure to not only understand the passage, but also find a way to successfully and efficiently use the format to my understanding. I felt like having a format that I was used to really helped with my understanding of the passage, so having a paragraph format is much better for my academic learning.","I prefer passage 2's format and I think it is more helpful for my academic learning. I am already used to such a format so I don't have to worry about learning a new format, but I have also found it much easier to learn through reading and rereading, rather than looking at diagrams of text (like the format from passage 1). While I did find it helpful that passage 1 had directional arrows that went from a broad topic to narrower topics, as it made it easier to distinguish between the overall broad subject and the details about the subject, passage 2 had the same exact concept, so overall, I prefer passage 2 for my academic learning.","I found that the format of passage 2 a lot more helpful for my academic learning. In my classes right now, I find myself liking to read the content and then rewrite it in my own words. This easily allows me to take the direct content from a professor and relearn it in a way that allows me to understand it. However, it was extremely difficult to follow Passage 1's format because I wasn't used to it and sometimes the information was long and turned into run-on sentences. I remember starting to feel frustrated with that passage just because it was so hard to understand what each pathway of information was saying. Therefore, I feel that passage 2's format is much easier for me to not only read, but also retain information for my academic learning."

I didn't have to keep moving my eyes around to read.  Passage 2 was overwhelming.,I think the first one was easier to read because of the paragraph format.

This specific and exact hearing can be demonstrated through the Barn Owls extending their talons and rotating them to catch prey such as a mouse running away or one that's changing direction. This movement of their talons shows the Barn Owl's incredible hearing since it can coordinate movement for the Barn Owl in response to an auditory stimulus even in the darkness of the night. Barn Owls also have very striking faces.",,a,b,d,c,b,d,c,b,d,a,Wed Mar 02 2022 20:23:08 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time),10,1,571,Sat Mar 05 2022 12:23:46 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time),30,0.21428571428571427,0.572575967622489,Sat Mar 05 2022 12:18:43 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time),299,"Barn Owls are very great hunters, because they often hunt at night, they rely more on their sense of hearing to locate their prey rather than their eyesight. Barn Owls have comparable hearing to humans in the azimuth, which is the horizontal plane, but have about three times better specific hearing in the vertical dimension than humans. Because they hunt from above, they need to be able to hear what is below them and where their prey is located. Barn Owls have are deadly hunters due to their ability to their change in direction of their talons, which they use to catch prey, such as mice. When a Barn Owl is bearing down on a prey, they can quickly change the orientation of their talons as a way to catch a moving or dodging prey. Within their ears, Barn Owls have individual neurons that only fire when a sound is detected from a specific point in space, giving the exact location of the noise to Barn Owls.

Barn Owls have extremely striking faces, yet it is their ability to hunt in complete darkness from above that may be their most impressive trait. Barn Owls have about the same hearing in the azimuth, horizontal dimension, as humans, yet can hear three times better in the vertical dimension than humans. This is very important for Barn Owls, as they are able to locate potential prey from the air. Barn Owls have individual neurons that when one is stimulated by an auditory noise, sends a signal to the Barn Owl indicating where exactly in space the sound came from. This is extremely helpful as Barn Owls hunt at night rather than the daytime. An example of how effective this hearing is for Barn Owls, when they are bearing down on a prey, say a mouse for example, they are able to realign their talons with a mouse that is running or moving side to side. By realigning their talons in an instant, they are able to intercept the prey despite the best efforts of the prey to evade.

The format serves well for the two different types of passages. The first passage being an introduction to lots of math/economic concepts, so the mapping structure helps me find key word and relationship between concepts more easily and clearly. The second passage is more of a science passage. There are more descriptions and less concepts or relations there. So the second one that have less ""mapping"" is also suitable for the knowledge it represents.","Previously, I thought Passage 1 was easier for me to read but after several days when I tried to recall the content of the passage, I learned better from the second passage. But it might due to the content of the passage. The content of the second passage are more approachable than the first one given that I do not have background knowledge for both passages. The first one contains many ""nodes"" and relations between those nodes. It is better for me when I have more time and can memorize all the nodes and the relationship. But given a short time, I could only learn and recall a small part of the nodes. When reading further nodes, I might forget about the previous nodes. For the second passage, although the structure is not as specific/well-defined as the first one, I can grasp the main idea and the general structure of the passage, instead of being overwhelmed by the details/relations within the passage. Therefore, both serve as a good format of learning but just for different situations. The first one is better for long-time learning and the second one is better for short-time.","Previously I think the first one would be easier to read since it has clear structure. But partly because of the difficulty of the content, I remembered less from the first part then the second part. The second passage, although with less structure or logical connections between concepts, the only structure proves to be very effective. I suppose in this case, too much structure or map-like representation might hinder understanding when I try to learn things in a short time. For a person who is completely unfamiliar with a topic, a more bottom-up (not sure about the term) structure like the second passage might be more helpful than the top-down structure like the first passage. The first passage might be better for people who have some prior knowledge in the topic and prepare to use them in academic context."

I think it is pretty useful and important in my academic learning since in this way I could first get insights into the big picture and then fill each concept with the details. The clear relationships between concepts shown in a concise way are also crucial in academic learning.,"As for a long-time learning, the first passage provides a better mind map for me. As I mentioned in the last question, the first one provides a clear structure for every concepts involved in the topic; this is what I need for academic learning. Also, the kind of ""top-down"" (not sure I used the correct word) representation where I learn the larger concept and then dig into the details is very useful in academic area and researches. The second aims at a more general learning. I can quickly get the main ideas in the passage but as the content are less ""structured"" and ""bottom-up"" (by ""bottom-up"" I mean learning the details of the concepts first) I might not be able to learn much details or have a solid knowledge in the topic.","For academic learning in the area I have some prior knowledge, I would say the first one is more effective. I could quickly locate the concepts that I want to find and its relationship with other concepts. In academic studies or researches, it might be better for me to learn the new concepts and then find any details that I do not understand. The second one is easy to understand but if I would like to use this in academic context, for example in an exam, it would be harder to find a particular concepts. It also depends on the content that we want to represent. Scientific articles for general public and math material for more academic level should obviously be represented in different ways."

Before learning about the abilities of barn owls, it was believed that humans possessed the best ability to recall the locations of sounds; however, while barn owls and humans are equal in this ability on the ground, barn owls are three times as able in higher elevation. Barn owls' hearing abilities were studied after researchers realized that even in the dark, their talons reposition in accordance with the movement of mice that they are trying to hunt. Their auditory skills are in part due to barn owls' ear positioning (with one slightly higher than the other) and also due to their facial structure. They possess troughs (ridge-like structures) not here faces that are composed of auditory-wise transparent feathers. Furthermore, barn owls' midbrain is organized such that they are able to easily process sounds for hunting.

Research discovered that while on the ground, barn owls possess similar abilities as humans to detect the location which sound is coming from, when elevated in the air, barn owls' detection of this location is three times greater than humans'. The facial structure and midbrain structure in barn owls aid with these skills. Their faces contain two troughs that are 3 cm wide and 9 cm longer and that comprise of auditorally transparent feathers that allow for sound to pass through and be channeled in the right direction.

Researchers first observed this behavior through noticing how barn owls' talons would shift to align with the position of mice even when they could not see the mice. Thus, more research was conducted on barn owls' hearing abilities. Barn owls are about as adept as humans at detecting the location of sound in azimuth (the horizontal plane); however, in elevation, barn owls are three times greater than humans.

He found this experience to bring great joy. Giant pandas also play a significant role in diplomacy and conservation efforts in China, thought to represent yin and yang. Wang believes that the focus on giant pandas has caused more people to be aware of necessary environmentalism efforts and also to learn about how complex the movement to conserve the environment is, requiring thought to economics in addition to biology. Some critics of Wang have argued that trying to help animals via zoos is useless because the main threat to these animals is habitat destruction. However, Wang believes that zoos provide necessary spaces for animals like pandas to grow and reproduce. The National Zoo in Washington, D.C., for example, has created its panda exhibit to reflect their natural environment.

Dr. Wang argues that public sentiment favoring great pandas has caused more interest in conservation efforts worldwide, and zoos across the world have begun to help great pandas breed. In particular, the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., which was formed in 2006, raised a great panda Bao Bao which brought many to visit the zoo. Furthermore, the great panda exhibit has grown since then and underwent a renovation which expanded its size. The exhibit mimics pandas' natural environment and also now includes resources for visitors, such as places in which they can experience panda habitats and Decision Stations where they can learn about the ethics and economic aspects of conservation -- learning about conservation efforts requiring work from more than just biologists.

Several of Dr. Wang's contributions have been implemented in zoos to help conserve and breed pandas. Critics of Dr. Wang argue that the greatest threat to panda extinction is the destruction of their environments.

Particularly, Dr. Wang points out that pandas like Bao Bao (who was brought to the National Zoo of Washington, DC) have garnered much public attention which has in turn caused people to be more focused and concerned about conservation. Within China, great pandas are a symbol of diplomacy and very important as they represent yin and yang and have aided the conservation effort. In the U.S. as well, the National Zoo has garnered much attention due to Bao Bao and other pandas that arrived afterwards.

However, in terms of remembering the specific details, I wonder if I actually retained more of Passage 1. I do feel as though this might have occurred because I did have to reread several aspects of Passage 1 and sift through the information. The higher amount of cognitive effort the passage required perhaps resulted in me learning the ""facts"" and ""answers"" better. For academic learning, I think sometimes both skills are useful in different ways.

From the number of possible points, it appears that there was overall more content in Passage 1 than Passage 2 which is what I mentioned in my response during the previous test, so I'm having a hard time interpreting my scores, as proportionally my score for Passage 2 was technically higher out of the total content available than the proportion correct for Passage 1. It does look like I retained more content overall in Passage 1, though. Also, I scored surprisingly well on the pretest for Passage 1, which I think made it easier for me to remember/guess my test answers later on and repeat them in my written responses. For passage 2, my score did improve a lot from the initial pretest. I think I would maintain that if I had to give an impromptu presentation or speech on a topic, I would prefer Passage 2, but if I had to take a memorization test, I would prefer Passage 1."

She was also very impatient with the narrator, and thought of him as a perosn to just rehearse her ideas to to incrase her worldliness.

Having all my information in one place, or having the information not be widely spread around, makes it easier for me to retain. It also is more useful for me as if I forget a piece of information, I know the general area of where I had read it, which makes it easier to locate and re-read. ","I think passage 1 helps my academic learning more as the flow of thought is logical, coherent, and easy to track, making the information easier to retain. Since it is in larger chunks, I also find it easier to go back and try to find a piece of information, since I already vaguely know which area to look in. ","After seeing the scores, I think both formats are around the same level of helpful for my academic learning. I think its easier to remember pieces of information when asked mcq questions, as the gist of the passage is more easily retained, and both forms of representation allowed me to largely remember what each passage is about. Both of them do contain a lot of details however, and from the scores, it seems as if the second format works better for me for academic learning, as it forces me to remember connections between different pieces of information in order to retain them better and for longer periods of time.

The conservationist remembers specifically about a time when a mama panda trusted the conservationist and brought the 2 baby pandas to him to keep an eye on them. The top node discusses the conservationist's contribution to a specific zoo. The zoo wanted to innovate the panda exhibit. Using the knowledge from the conservatonist as well as other researchers, a panda exhibit was designed similar to the original habitat of the panda, for the idea of introducing the pandas back to the wild. There is an ongoing issue of trying to keep animals in zoos rather than getting them ready to go back into the wild.

That made it more difficult, as the asymmetry for the nodes would often lead to me hesitating while reading. I also did have trouble as it felt like there were arrows pointed all over the diagram. Personally, I liked passage 1 better as it felt like each node had more complete thoughts that could mean something on its own. Whenever I looked at passage 2 diagrams, it also felt a bit daunting to start at the top and continue reading until I got to the bottom node.","There were full sentences, which I found to be much easier as complete thoughts make ideas flow better in my mind, vs having to read a different node for every few letters. I also liked how passage 1 had 1 path to follow throughout in comparison to passage 2 which had multiple paths.",I still believe that the user interface of the first passage was much easier to read. It was easier on the eyes since more information was in a box rather than them being in very individual boxes.

Trap-jaw ants evolved extremely powerful jaws, capable of opening almost to a 180 degree angle and of closing so powerfully their structure causes them to decelerate in order to avoid hurting the ant itself.  One notable feature of these jaws is the fact that the ants evolved a way to launch themselves into the air by striking their jaws against the ground, something which the passage compares to popping popcorn.  There are two major uses for this ability: the ants are capable of using them to escape danger and potentially reposition themselves to deal with the danger; and the ants are capable of launching themselves at an invader and tackling them out of the nest after grabbing them.  This ability appears to have developed by accident, the result of the ants hitting their heads against the ground, but it now is a major part of their ability to survive.

Trap-jaw ants have evolved extremely powerful jaws, capable of opening to almost a 180 degree angle and closing fast enough that their structure actually forces them to decelerate in order to prevent the ant from hurting itself.  These jaws also allow the ants to make use of an unusual defensive feature: by striking their jaws against the ground, they can launch themselves into the air.  This allows them to temporarily escape from danger and reposition themselves.  It also allows them to tackle a target, potentially hard enough to launch the target with them.  This can be use to expel intruders from the ant's nest.  Unusually, this ability might have evolved by accident, with the ant discovering they could do it after hitting their heads on the ground.

Since passage 2 was hard to focus while reading, although is format might prove beneficial for the reader to recall its structure (which effect I noticed in my attempt to answer the multiple-choice questions for passage 2--the parts of the passage where I extracted the answers seemed to be more clear in my mind and thus more easily picked out and recalled; whereas in passage 1, I could not remember which name correlated to wich section of the passage), the sheer amount of information which I can recall made me feel more confident in answering questions related to passage 1 than 2. 
Also, comparing the process of answering the first (writing) question for each passage, I found that question 1 for passage 1 was much less challenging. I think that this is because I structured the knowledge gained from passage 1 in a more linear and feed-forward way, quite similar to a causal chain, the format which most people write an expository piece; on the contrary, information in passage 2 seemed more distributed--I was not able to extract the complete causal relationship of passage 2 in the amount of time given for me to read it, and I had to form this logical relationship based on my own surmise. ","I hold a similar opinion to the previous two responses that I have given. Passage 1 is much more fluid in logic and passage 2 is distracting. 
I think that my scores might not accurately reflect my level of understanding to both passages--as formerly discussed, I think that my understanding of the first passage was much more logical and uni-directionally linear, while my understanding for the second passage was more of a field of distributed ideas. Here are two anecdotal evidences. First, the time it took me to read the first and second passages were different: as I remember, I think that I spent around 6 minutes reading the first passage, while I spent around 10 minutes reading the second passage. Second, I felt that in the first trial, answering questions for the second passage was much more involved in going back to the passage and extracting the answer, where for the first passage the answers came generally from my memory; on the subsequent trials, the memory of the passages were not as important because I remembered many of the questions and their answers.

However, passage 1 is much easier to read than passage 2, to which I might attribute to attention (which I discussed in the former question) and familiarity with this form of communication. Also, comparing passage 1 to plain text, I feel that it gives me a easier glance at the complete picture of the passage, and therefore it is easier to follow its logic and easier for me to retrieve information after reading; however, a caveat is that I would be more easily guided or misguided by the author who summarized the logical connections of the first passage (which might or might not be accurate and/ or biased).
I feel that if I am already familiar to the content, then passage 2's format would be more helpful in recording and reviewing; when I am new to the content, I would prefer to read it in the traditional format (plain text) or the format of passage 1. ","Experience from answering questions today supported my feeling from last week about this question, that the format of passage 2 would perhaps be useful in reviewing and note-taking. Passage 2, although harder to read, would be more easily recalled in a content-addressed manner--that is, not completely in free writing but given the prompts in multiple-choice questions. The main downfall of passage 2 is that its structure seems distracting at first glance, but once the structure is obtained it would seem more clear. ","I also feel similar to my previous responses that passage 2, although harder to understand for me, might be more easily remembered. 
However, a new caveat that I feel about formats in passage 2 is that it might lead the student down the wrong tract when remembering. From my experience, since my memory of the first passage forms a logical stream while my memory of the second passage was like a field of distributed pieces, memory of passage 1 is inherently capable of more degrees of error correction--wrong information would lead more likely to inconsistent logic; while on the other hand, wrong information about passage 2 might not lead to inconsistency as likely because the strong logical connections were more local. Pesonally, I feel that when I was responding to questions (especially the writing response) about passage 2, I felt a bit of an unease; this was because that I was doubting whether the logical chain which I formed to answer the questions was the same as the passage's--I was trying to reverse-engineer the logic based on my field of ideas, while on contrast for passage 1 I obtained this logical chain when I was reading and remembering.

One chunk also speaks of Christine Craft, who was hired for having an ""acceptable appearance"" in January 1981, and was fired in August 1981 because viewers found her to be not attractive enough to be a credible source of information.

She filed a lawsuit against her company for sexism, and an investigation into the matter revealed that, because the audience didn't like how she physically looked, they therefore found her less credible as a source of information.

I think this method is better for subjects like math and science. The arrangement could simplify mathematical/scientific properties such as the different shapes of a line and what formulas correspond to that.

Passage 2 made more sense intuitively as to how to make sense of it, whereas Passage 1 took some time to familiarize myself. That being said, I liked the way Passage 1 was designed in that there weren't large blocks of text that I had to shift through (which was definitely the first thing that jumped out at me for Passage 2). I think Passage 1 was also helpful in giving me an overarching theme/question that I should be thinking about in relation to everything I read, more so than Passage 2; I feel like Passage 1 felt very neat. If there were more passages of that design to practice with then perhaps I would feel more strongly for Passage 1, but just going off of the knowledge recall tests in this experiment I think Passage 2 was simply more conveniently laid out. ","Although I said Passage 2 felt easier to read during the 1st Experiment Session last week, now that I think about it again I feel like Passage 1 might be easier to read than Passage 2. Even though the format requires more familiarization, Passage 1 feels easier to grab pieces of information from different subtopics and larger questions and categories than in Passage 2 where there are just blocks of information. Passage 2 is structured in a way that is similar to how I would read a book: from top to bottom and left to right. However, for most of the reading materials in my academic studies I rarely read this way; I usually just try to isolate the most important parts of the reading and pull the main ideas from these parts, filling in details later as needed. As someone who reads a lot of research papers this is especially the case. With this in mind, I think Passage 1 is more convenient to read because I don't feel overwhelmed with information and I can piece together the bits of information into a larger story more easily. ","I think both knowledge representation formats were easy to read, once I got familiar with them. Passage 2 made more intuitive sense as to how I should go about reading it. Passage 1 also felt easy to read in the sense that information was separated into smaller groups, which made things easier to digest (though looking at the passage again now I do feel a little overwhelmed with the amount of pages and information on each page). For the purpose of this test, both passages were easy enough to read for me to extract the particular information I needed for a question. However, if there wasn't the test component to reading the passages I think Passage 2 might be slightly easier to read simply because I feel like it takes less time to go through all the pages, even though it might not be as effective for retaining information. If there was a way to make the subsection I'm looking at in Passage 1 more clearly identifiable in terms of how it relates to the larger question (such as having a menu bar somewhere), I feel like that might have made it accessible a little more quickly.

I think for more theoretical subject matter such as data science or chemistry, it would be important for me to have information grouped together like in Passage 2, as opposed to each individual piece of information existing on its own. However, for more recall-based subjects like reading comprehension or biology, it would be helpful to have an idea of how a certain specific piece of information fits into larger concepts, processes and questions. As someone who is pursuing a career track related to neuroscience and biology, I feel like I have utilized some variation of both knowledge representations but not exactly formatted in this way, so with more practice I definitely could see myself incorporating these formats in my academic learning. ","Continuing from my previous response, I think Passage 1 is more helpful for my academic learning than Passage 2. In Passage 2, the way the blocks of information are grouped makes it difficult to understand why I need to know XYZ in the larger scheme of a topic. I was surprised to find myself unable to recall even just the basic ideas about Passage 2 in this session. I had vague recollections of some facts in my mind from the reading, but a lot of the details were missing pieces of information and I also had a hard time making the details relate to each other. On the other hand, even if I didn't recall a lot of things from Passage 1, for all the details I remembered in Passage 1 I had a much fuller and clearer picture as to how the details related to each other and the larger ideas of the reading. I'd hope to actually understand how things work and why things are the way they are for the things I study in my academic learning, as opposed to simply recalling bits and pieces of disjointed information, so I think Passage 1 would be the most helpful knowledge representation format. ","Even if I didn't have the test scores to compare my knowledge retention for the two passages, I feel much more confident in my understanding of the subject matter using the knowledge representation format of Passage 1 than Passage 2. Of course, it should be noted that the content of the passages matters; Passage 1 was about a story, and stories can fit into our memory more easily and for longer than facts and concepts (such as in Passage 2). It would be interesting to conduct a similar research experiment but with the knowledge representation formats switched for the two passages, to assess the extent to which the content of the passage affects the effectiveness of the representation format. Nonetheless, I felt that categorizing all the information of the passage as in Passage 1 made it easier for me to digest the subject material. As I mentioned in last experiment session's reflection, as someone in the field of molecular biology and medicine I will need to understand not only all the small details of a system or pathway such as the name of a protein, but also how those small details fit into systems and pathways on a broader scale. I feel like Passage 1 would be very useful with learning this type of information, since all the subsections point to a broader main question/idea that the passage is discussing. With Passage 2, I felt like I could barely recall any of the information during the second experiment session and even less information during today's experiment session, even though I thought I understood a decent amount of the information from the Passage. I think my written response scores are the best indicator for whether I understood the subject material, since I have to recall information from scratch. "

The first one read a little more like a traditional passage that I'm used to seeing but broken up with arrows that showed the relationships between the different paragraphs so I liked that I could easily go back and find the section I wanted. It also allowed me to read out of order and piece together information in a way that made sense to me. I remembered certain questions and was able to see quickly which chunk of text to refer to and answer the questions in the order I chose. The second passage took a minute to figure out but I also liked that at was easy to navigate at a glance. This is the type of diagram that I generally make for my self when I'm navigating a difficult passage which is why I liked it a lot, and because I find it easier to digest the text with short phrases and arrows rather than large blocks of text. ","They both made sense for the information they presented and are both representations by which I take notes in class. The passage about Reena had a lot more little details to remember and so the boxes with little bits of information was easier to understand after seeing the example and getting some time with it. The passage about television had more paragraphs that connected the causes/effects between ideas and the structure of the boxes with the arrows showing that relationship made more sense because the passage had big ideas to convey instead of specific details. Things like books Reena read, or qualities of her parents were more specific and the smaller boxes with less information in each made it easier to see and relate them to each other. In the TV passage, I liked that it was easy to see the Christine Craft example in a box that came after the talking hairdos reference to show the funnel from big/broad ideas to narrower more specific examples. ","I think each representation was easy to read for the information it was presenting. The passage about TV had bigger ideas and the chart organized them in a way that made sense for how the paragraphs were organized. The Reena passage had more specific and small details that were important to the story and the chart arranged this information well by breaking it up. During both tests and written responses, I could see in my head where the information was in the charts and I could visualize where to ""look"" for information because they organized it efficiently for what they presented. I do not think I would have had as easy of a time if the TV passage was organized like the Reena passage and vice versa. With large blocks of text, I tend to skip around and gloss over details and the Reena passage did not allow me to do that. The TV passage also broke the passage down and each box contained related information so I felt like I read a lot more carefully and was able to use other information in the box to piece together what I had forgotten.

As I mentioned, I usually make visual diagrams of the texts I read in my notes to help me understand and in classes with heavy scientific readings, I've found I lean more towards the style of passage 2 because there are so many definitions and complex relationships. However, in classes where I'm reading a shorter articles or texts with less technical jargon, the format of the first passage is faster and easier for me since I don't spend as much time with definitions and focus more on the big picture. In my biochemistry class, I found making a visual like the one in passage 2 helped me see how processes happened and add in definitions and where certain organelles or enzymes connected to other processes in the body. Conversely, in my education classes where I learned about the school system, the format of passage 1 more closely resembled my notes since I wasn't focused on specific definitions but rather relationships and causes/effects as a whole. ","For me, it depends on the type of information being presented. Like I said, this is very similar to how I take notes and I found that in classes with a lot more specific, small details, such as my Biochemistry class, I find that a chart with more boxes and arrows with less information in each box makes sense because I can see the connection and each detail gets the space and arrows it needs to show that relationship. In the Reena diagram, there was a lot of detail to remember and read that was very specific so this format made sense to give each detail the spotlight. In my psychology classes, I find that a diagram like the TV one is better able to show how big ideas are related to one another and I can see cause and effect. This diagram still allows for information, but I spend much less time on very specific or tiny details and more on the study as a whole, its findings, and the effect on what phenomena I'm studying. Looking back, however, I felt like I remembered more of the Reena passage since I remembered a lot of tiny boxes.","It depends on the information I'm learning. Like I mentioned, I've used both formats when making notes for myself and it depends on if I'm organizing big ideas or detailed information that determines which representation I lean towards. I find that in classes with a lot of vocabulary/parts, the Reena passage format makes sense. When I was learning about the citric acid cycle in biochemistry, this format worked because I could see the order through which substrates were made but also I could see what else these parts related to, like if they showed up in other processes or had other functions. I could add definitions and elaborate as I needed and show relationships with this format without being overwhelmed by the information. Conversely, in my psychology classes, I found a format like passage 1 to be more helpful because often times the vocabulary/specific details didn't require as much effort as being able to relate a concept to a study or see large scale relationships between ideas.

However, around the time that she was growing, girls going to school became very normal. When she went to school, she was taken to a field trip where she saw a performance. She instantly fell in love with the idea of performing and when she grew up she applied to many performing centers but ultimately got rejected. She wept for days. Despite the rejection, she continued to go to the performances and found that even though she felt sad, she was very happy to watch the performances. She had a son who was in Miami, he wanted his mother to visit him but Alice often refused because she thought that the performances were must better in Cuba. Her son Alejandro came up with an idea to surprise her and buy tickets to a performance that he knew she would not be able to see in Cuba. Eventually, Alice went to Miami and realized that she had the best time of her life watching the performance. At the end, she hugged her son as a gesture to portray how thankful she was for him to buy her tickets to the performance.

The second passage was very straight forward as well because it included a structured story.,The second passage had a clear organization of the story and it was easier to follow than the first passage. The first passage had more contents to click which took up more time to read the passage. ,I think that passage 2 was helpful because I was able to understand a lot of information in 6 boxes. Reading information from less boxes with organization helps to process the story much better. Passage 1 was harder to read because I had to keep clicking multiple boxes to understand the story.

The ants also have very fast jaws that decelerate as they chomp down in order to protect their bite. Their bites hurt. Trying to catch the ants is like trying to catch hot, freshly-popped popcorn. The ants have an ability to bounce around 10x their body height, which gives them an advantage of gaining a new approach in attack (and also helps them escape from predators). They have two dominant combat methods, I think one is the really powerful jaw and the other is the jumping.

The ants are able to slam their jaws on the ground which propels them in (a generally uncontrollable in the sense that they don't know what direction it is sometimes) an overhead direction which gives them an escape but also a new perspective for attack. They also can hit the ground and propel their attacker and themselves in opposite directions. Their jaws have a slowing-down mechanism so that the power of the jaws slamming together does not hurt the ants.

It allowed me to have enough insight on the story to answer the questions semi-correctly, but it wasn't user-friendly enough for me to say that I actually learned anything. The main take back from passage 1 was not the actual contents of the story, but instead how frustrated I was trying to piece together this flow chart puzzle. 

I often get bored trying to digest information from long, drawn-out passages, so the format of passage 2 allowed me to quickly grasp the overall topic for each passage, and the body within it told me exactly what i needed to know in relation to that topic. If you were to ask me to recall information about the evolution of the ants, I would be able to identify something that was below that heading in the box (i.e. researchers speculate the behavior might have been randomly adapted). Passage 2's method was pretty helpful for my academic learning. ","If Passage two was also a story like Passage one, I would have been able to retain more information for later recall. Content aside, passage two had a great organization in my opinion. I like that it was easy to find information because it was all on one page, as opposed to the several pages for Passage one. It also had full sentences and above each paragraph included a quick descriptive couple of words that indicated what each section entailed. The flow chart was a little confusing because it seemed a little choppy, but it wasn't nearly as bad as passage one's maze.   ",I liked that passage 2 used headers for each body of text.

I didn't need to try and remember where many small boxes were, it was easier to memorize where 5 or 6 bigger boxes were with more information in them. It was easier to answer the questions with the bigger boxes because they were easier to navigate. ","I thought Passage 2 was easier to read because of the way the information was presented. Having fewer boxes that contained more information was easier fro me to remember and was easier to recall as an image in comparison to Passage 1 that was a long web of facts that stretched over many different links. I had to focus on where the links to what information was while I was trying to formulate answers to the questions being asked. When answering the questions to Passage 2, it was much easier to find and recall the information from the Passage because it was easier to memorize the web that had few but in depth parts. It was easier to memorize a central idea to each of the 5 or 6 boxes rather than remember the details spread out over 20 different little boxes within other links. I probably got more questions right on Passage 2 than Passage 1. I think I also finished Passage 2 in less time. It was easier for me to memorize the few key details from Passage 1 that I had previous associations with, like the movie The Departed,I have watched, and the argument that text messaging reduces human interactions which I had written an essay on last year. I didn't remember the two inventors of the text message which I find a pretty important detail and I didn't remember the significance of the War of Independence without seeing it. In conclusion, Passage 2 was much easier to remember due to the simplicity of the graph being presented and only having to remember 5 or 6 key ideas that were being presented in comparison to 20 or so facts that were presented in Passage 1. ","I think Passage 2 was easier to read because the information was given in a way that was easier to remember. I didn't have to navigate through multiple different details to find other details. Passage 2 was a much easier spatial map for me to internalize and remember where all of the details were to the best of my abilities. Clearly this reflect in my data. I scored the exact same 7/9 on the test questions for passage 2. Passage 1 results do fluctuate after I read the article. Although I'm not sure how the written response is graded, I feel that the written response for the second passage was much better because I just remembered more of the specific details because of the way the information was represented. When the information is presented in a way that there are 5-6 boxes to remember, it was much easier for me to remember in comparison to the 20 something little details I needed to navigate through. Passage 2 was also easier to read because it was clearly precise paragraphs in comparison to short details presented in Passage 1. "

If I made an easy to replicate chart of information that is separated into 5 or 6 boxes, the information is much easier to remember. It's also easier to remember the formation or image of the 5-6 box diagram rather than a diagram with 20 little boxes. It's easier to chunk the information with less boxes too. Although the passages are longer, it's better to have a paragraph with a central main idea rather than strings of facts. Central ideas I feel are easier to remember rather than long lists of associations that would need to be recalled in order to accurately retain information in the Passage format. I found myself not remembering where all of the information was when I had to answer questions for Passage 1 and found Passage 2 much easier to complete. ","I find Passage 2 more helpful to my academic learning because it's most important to get a concrete understanding of the topics and then the details rather than 20 facts. If it's a vocabulary quiz for example, memorization is necessary but for application exams like math, a bunch of facts is not going to suffice as a helpful learning tool when studying. Passage 2 summarized the main ideas in an easy to read format and made it easier for me to remember the information being presented because I had an easy to remember image in my head of hat the web looked like, and where each box of information was located, and tried my best to not leave any out when writing the summary at the end. ","Passage 2 was presented in a format that would be helpful for my academic learning because it was easier to remember. When it is exam time and I need to be able to recall different topics of information, the spatial map was much easier to recall. I didn't need to spend much time thinking about it either. I just tried to remember where each of the topic was on the screen and recite that information the best that I could. I think it shows in my data that the information was retained the best with a Passage 2 format in comparison to Passage 1. Passage 2 was able to cover a lot of information and it was just easier to remember it all accurately. "

Though, Fields argues that text messaging can be potentially damaging to our society. This is due to the lack of in-person interactions and also the lack of human connections. She argues that text messaging takes away the connection from relationships and results in a very robotic society.

Also, the passage referred to ""time is money"" stating that text messages have allowed for faster communication therefore our lives were more convenient. Though, there were many criticisms of text messages. One person, Fields, had said that humans have lost social connection due to text messages. People have started to have less in person and social interactions with text messages being so fast and convenient.

Also, the phrase ""Time is money"" is really applicable when talking about text messages because texts save time and allow people to focus on other aspects of their life. Though, on the contrary, many people, such as Fields, argue that text messaging has been a damaging factor in society, especially for social connections. She argues that with text messaging, people spend less time engaging in physical and in-person social events that lead to deeper connections. There is also an argument stating that text messages are just not the same as letters, which provides this uniqueness in physical communication.

News is becoming more of a source of entertainment according to the author rather than a source to get reliable and comprehensive information.
The Now this format may be so that viewers can join the broadcast at any time and not miss too much due to a lack of continuity.
Each segment is approximately 8 minutes long so that they don't lose the viewer's attention and so that new people joining can follow the next story even if they missed the context for this one.
Now this can signal many things including that this topic is not related to the previous one, stop thinking about the previous topic and this is true regardless of how impactful the story is it can jump fmo natural disaster or murder to the next topic without giving viewers proper time to process the information they were just given.",,c,b,a,b,d,a,c,a,d,,Wed May 25 2022 10:13:29 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),9,1,452,Sat May 28 2022 09:29:37 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),15,0.26785714285714285,0.4558603083109296,Sat May 28 2022 09:24:34 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),299,"The author believes that the way we watch news now is not for gathering information but rather it is for entertainment.

The author also believes that the Now This 8 minute segments make it so that people don't get to fully process the information given to them, in that even if the topic is something serious like murder or natural disaster the segment ends in 8 mins and then it's on to the next story.
The author says that the 8 minute segments are designed so that a viewer can join in at anytime and not feel too far behind or lack context because even if the viewer joined halfway through one story in just a short while there will be a completely new story and the viewer wont have to be confused.
The author also says that the news anchors have to be attractive, he had a case of one female reporter who got fired because of what she believes as sexism and her not meeting the cultures beauty standards.
The author says the news anchors are talking hairdos in that they have to look good and that this sentiment is not new. In ancient times people who deliver bad news were punished so in order to make it so that the bad news giver is not hated having them be attractive helps.
The author also said that television news is not a good source of actual factual info it's become a source of entertainment these days.

The Now This segments make it so that the news shifts from one topic to another without giving people enough time to fully process the previous topic.
This 8 minutes per segment strategy was put in place so that people who join in midway through a broadcast don't feel like they've missed too much because no matter what in a few minutes a different unrelated topic will pop up.
The appearance of the newscaster is also important which is shown through the author's description of them as talking hairdos. 
More attractive anchors are often chosen to represent the news on TV because if the person looks pleasing to the average person the people are more likely to keep watching and this was demonstrated in the case of the one reporter I think her name was Cindy something. She sued the news station on the basis of sexism because she believed that she was fired because of her appearance. 
The author thinks that jumping to a new segment regardless of whether the previous segment included serious things like death, or natural disaster is harmful in that the quick changes in topic don't allow us to properly process what happened.",,c,b,a,b,d,a,c,a,d,,Wed Jun 01 2022 10:01:48 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),9,1,112,H2,Wed May 25 2022 10:42:37 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),Wed May 25 2022 10:32:58 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),H2,Sat May 28 2022 09:56:46 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),,H2,Wed Jun 01 2022 10:16:52 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),Wed Jun 01 2022 10:09:57 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),"I think Passage 2 was easier to read because it was broken down into digestible chunks whereas Passage 1 has broken down by like every couple of words. When answering the comprehension questions, for Passage 2 it was easier to determine where to look because I know what the topic of each box is for Passage 1 I tried to reference back to the flow chart if I was confused about an answer but then I just decided to go off of memory because I didn't know where to look and I'd waste too much time searching for it. Passage 1 was not only hard to reference it was difficult to read in the first place as it lost the flow of a typical sentence I found myself rereading the previous box or words on the arrow because not only to the sentences divide at the intro they also divided at the subject and sometimes they divided at the verb so it was hard to separate one thought from another in Passage 1. I used my mouse less for Passage 2 because it was easier to follow the flow of a sentence but for Passage 1 I had to use my mouse to help my eyes follow the flow of a sentence.  That being said I think I read Passage 1 faster than I read Passage 2, but I think I understood Passage 2 better. ","Because the breaks in the passage weren't so frequent, when I read Passage 1 on Wednesday it was so hard to even follow because the sentences broke and branched off at like every few words making me have to use my mouse to trace a line through each sentence so that my eyes don't get lost in the mess. I didn't like Passage 1 because of the way it was organized. Passage 2 was much better organized. I liked how there were a few sentences in each box that made it so that thought was contained neatly. Each box felt like it represented an instance or a theme, so it was easier to understand too. The sentences weren't fragmented allowing me to process each sentence properly without getting it confused with a nearby sentence either. 

Another thing that makes it a little harder to answer this question is that the two Passages were different types, if both Passage 1 and Passage 2 were narratives or if both were informational, then the two would be more comparable, Passage 1 was much more accessible to a normal person than Passage 2 because the characters in Passage 2 are so unfamiliar I was reading it but I didn't care about it at all. Passage 1 I had more personal connection to it as I was reading it I was thinking ohh yeah the people who do local news are attractive the news segments are only about 8 minutes long even as I was watching the news on Wednesday evening I was thinking about it I can assure you that I wasn't thinking about Reena. Even though Passage 1 was incredibly hard to read due to it's formatting I might have scored better on those tests just because the material was more relatable and therefore formed stronger connection in my brain I was connected to Passage 1, Passage 2 was about random people I don't know and can't relate to it doesn't stick as well regardless of the format so I wouldn't be surprised if I remember less from it today even though I felt I understood it better when I read it on Wednesday. If both Passage are the same type narrative or informational and we did this study again I feel like the results for which type of formating is better might be clearer but that's just my opinion.",Passage 2 had fewer abrupt breaks. It had a nicer flow because it didn't break in the middle of a sentence as Passage 1 did. I liked how Passage 2 was broken up by idea rather than by every few words seemingly at random like Passage 1. I think Passage 2 was also easier to read because it was a narrative that is easier to follow than the facts presented in the piece that was a critique.

She decided to change her name from Doreen to Reena and demanded people call her her preferred name by not responding to her old name, correcting people who misreferenced her, and staring and pointing at them. Reena and the narrator weren't meant to be friends or at least weren't friends naturally since they didn't have a ton of common interests, Reena was very into history and Mature topics such as Hitler's invasion of Poland or Spains Civil War at the age of 12 but the narrarator was more into age appropriate literature. The narrator also thinks that Reena is beautiful but age does show on her face a little. The narrator then reflects on Reena's family and how her dad was funny but kept her a a distance, her mother strict forceful but also equally fun and effective.

This shows that she is an assertive character. The narrator also says that Reena has aged well. Then the narrator continues to reflect on how she and Reena aren't alike and how they wouldn't have been friends if it weren't for their mothers being friends. She talked about how Reena seemed more grown than her because she'd read and talk about Hitler's invasion of Poland, and the Civil War in Spain. Meanwhile the narrator was still captivated by books meant for her age. She said that Reena was impatient with her and made her feel less than.

This format sort of pre-organizes them for you. This way even when reviewing for an exam or just for the sake of better understanding a subject, if I know where I struggle I can just reread that box or branch of boxes rather than search through the entire passage to find the concept I am struggling with. I already use a similar strategy by highlighting different themes or main ideas in different colors but even then one paragraph may have multiple colors in it this format organizes the passage by theme so it is easier to process.","I think Passage 2 for the same reason I stated before, it looks like it is organized by theme so that would be very helpful in academic learning for subjects such as English when writing a summary of a book I just read or for history when trying to break down the aspects of the topic just covered. It also doesn't break off too many times which is nice. Another thing I liked about Passage 2 was that it wasn't always sequential, Passage one had a lot of circular box systems that seems like it's describing a series of events but it's hard to tell which is the starting event because there were so many breaks but Passage 2 had one central box and multiple boxes branching off of it and I think that can be very useful for a class like History because I'm thinking about a lesson I recently had on the causes of WW1 that's not just a series of sequential events there are multiple reasons each having their own sequence but all centralized to one thing I think Passage 2 style will be a great knowledge representation for that where each box can be a reason, in it explain what the reason is, then branch a box off of each of the reason boxes to say this caused this which caused this and explain each box. Don't break the boxes midsentence that's confusing. Even for my neuroscience courses Passage 2 can be a great way for me to practice and review my knowledge on things like learning and memory or sleep because those are conceptual topics. ",I think I'd like Passage 2 for my academic learning because it is organized by the main idea or topic. That is helpful because it helps me mentally categorize information better so that when I recall it I can recall all related things too because it's pregrouped. Another reason Passage 2 would be helpful is because it was able to show how one thing led to another like for the narrator feeling unwelcomed because Reena was impatient that was after we learned about how she didn't have raw edges and was reading all this grown-up stuff about Hitler so hearing how the narrator felt after learning about Reena made it stick better and that was because of the sequence.

This is in contrast to the first passage which, while containing segments of roughly a paragraph worth of writing, had just the right amount of separation and flow needed to grasp a full picture of what was happening. The strengths of the first passage style were the adequate level of context and detail and the helpful use of visual flow, while the weaknesses of the second passage are directly opposite of this in that there was a lack of context and detail while also having an overwhelming level of visual flow. Furthermore, the literature prompt of the second passage would seemingly benefit more from the paragraph style when compared to the panda passage, though the two were presented in the opposite way.","I think the omission of context, small details, and personality/flavor in the second passage made it very hard to follow and simply got the main points across. Furthermore, by nature of passage 2 being a story, context and personality/flavor is supremely important. When answering the free-form description of what I remembered, I found myself drawing from the context clues and details provided in the questions as opposed to the passage itself. Perhaps if the style of passage 2 were accompanied by more context in paragraph formats such as how passage 1 was portrayed, the two would balance each other out. While I believe passage 1 was easier to read, the content was a bit dryer in comparison and thus I felt that I had a harder time remembering the content. Perhaps the two different formats would be easier to understand if the content had been swapped. Still, the first passage was much easier to read in isolation of the questions compared to the second passage format, which felt very barebones and incomplete.","Passage 1 contained much more context and details surrounding the main exposition/content compared to passage 2 which only contained isolated exposition detached from its context. While this ease of reading may not be reflected in the test scores, this is likely due to my preference for literature style passages in combination with the fact that this piece of what I assume is fiction was more memorable and novel to me than the information on Panda conservation. As such, the main ideas were remembered more easily. Furthermore, the test questions themselves of passage 2 provided the much needed context clues much of the time and often were actually what helped make sense of the disjointed exposition of passage 2. In fact, without the context clues of the test questions, I am sure that my written responses would have been less detailed. In terms of the written responses, I performed markedly better on the written responses for passage 1 when compared to passage 2. This is likely due to the first passage having the additional context required to better grasp details while the question itself has no context clues to draw on. Thus, perhaps while passage 2's barebones style of presentation may be more conducive to getting across main ideas, passage 1's context paragraph style of presentation is certainly necessary to grasp details and make sense of the picture as a whole, despite the main exposition being more muddy."

In contrast, the second passage format contained far too much visual cues to the point where it was distracting and confusing while also providing far too few details and context. This was especially salient in the literature example where we are no longer able to grasp the perspective of the narrator and the contexts necessary to answer the passage questions.","I feel that the paragraph format of passage 1 is much more necessary for a literature style story that contains its own memorable scenes or details, while the barebone approach of passage 2 is more conducive to learning more quantitative based/scientific ideas as this content can be more dry at times, thus less interesting/unique, and thus less memorable. For instance, I very much remember certain details of the literature style story, but many of these details were drawn from the context clues of the questions themselves. Conversely, the less interesting and less flavorful text on pandas had little that stuck out to me and it was easier to get lost in the paragraph/I was not as captivated. Thus, I feel that including both styles of passages are most helpful as they cater to a greater variety of needs, but that this may only be necessary in certain fields such as the sciences where visual representations are less easily created in one's head.","As is evident, the style of presentation of Passage 2 is helpful enough to grasp main ideas and thus perhaps aids in answering multiple choice questions. Furthermore, it can provide a framework (schema) from which we can build off of after reading something presented with context as in passage 1. When it comes to actually defining learning however, I would argue that passage 2's format is much worse in assisting in raw understanding as one would simply be listing off facts they remember and meaningless plot points that may not be properly contextualized. Thus, I believe either passage 2's format should be provided before reading passage 1 format and thus serve as a preface skeleton from which one can build off of or passage 2's format should be presented after passage 1 to help in aiding memory of the main points as review. Thus I do not believe passage 2's format is as helpful in actually absorbing knowledge in a meaningful way as evidenced by the difference in written response scores when compared to the comparable/if not better test scores of passage 2. Furthermore, I believe this also adds to the literature questioning the effectiveness of multiple choice questions in the first place as, despite having good scores on the test questions for passage 2, even I don't feel like I fully grasp all the details of the story in passage 2."

Evolution has helped their jaws to become powerful and safe for them.

They have a mechanism that slowly takes away some of the power, so as not to hurt themselves in the process.

It  helps us reach the number of people our ancestors could not in their entire period of lifetime, too. However, critics like Fields suggest that it limits the realm of human's other experiences. Also, while we text others, we might be less concentrated and split our attention to other simultaneous activities such as TV-watching or chitchatting. But they concede that what is written in text messages are similar to what's conveyed in other forms of communication, so the effects might be the same in the long run.

I guess the second format would be even more helpful if I'm used to the format. It's like a map, and whenever you think about one concept shown on the graph, it reminds you of its intricate relationship with other concepts. The first format is more direct, and easier to find materials because I know in which section I read that information.

","I find Passage 2 helpful because an effective and efficient academic learning for me is to be able to form a good understanding and get the big picture, and I think the way Passage 2 presents knowledge is much clearer and will not create mental digression when I try to focus. If a presentation format can help me focus better, this would be really helpful for learning. ","If my learning goal is to read a long passage and be able to answer questions correctly based on the passage, I feel the format of Passage 2 is more helpful.

The relationships were defined, although not concisely, which made it all the more difficult to read.","Passage 1 was easier to read due to how the information was organized in a concise manner, very constricted to just one page which made it less overwhelming. Based on my scores, I still agree with my previous statement, because I was more willing to read through all of Passage 1, but not Passage 2. I read through Passage 1 more completely than Passage 2 because I assumed I could afford to; all of the information was contained and I could see it all in front of me at the same time, which made it less daunting.

When the narrator saw Reena, she was reminded of their childhood. Reena was said to be a spoiled child, self righteous and self serving; her father avoided her, and her mother was stern with her. Despite having many siblings, Reena made it seem as if she were an only child. The narrator didn't like Reena, but their mothers forced the girls to be friends.

They were friends because their mothers were friends and thought the two should be as well; this didn't work out, because Reena was completely unpleasant to be around and often just used the narrator to air her ideas and plans. The narrator, at least when she was a child, didn't really have a backbone, and so she never stood up to Reena. Instead Reena scared her, but for good reason. Reena was one of many children her mother and father had, but she somehow managed to make it seem as though she were an only child. Additionally, her father kept his distance from her and her mother didn't seem to like her very much. Reena was just selfish, and she had a way about her that could intimidate almost anyone into going along with her agenda. When she was young, she made everyone call her ""Reena"" instead of her birth name ""Dorena"". Aunt Vi was Reena's aunt, but the narrator felt particularly close to the woman.

For example, when studying for my college biology course, I used a study method similar to Passage 1's format; I had a main idea and then I connected other ideas. I found it very useful to rewrite my notes whilst making these connections because it was very visually appealing and my brain could better absorb the content. However, I tried Passage 2's format for a couple of lessons, and I found myself getting overwhelmed and lost. With science based courses, or at the very least courses which are very ""content heavy"" and ""memorization based"", Passage 1 would work wonderfully to condense your notes and connect main ideas, further cementing ""chunks"" of information into your brain so they stick. Passage 2 would be better suited for classes that are concept based, or are English courses. For example, when I would be plotting out a story idea for creative writing, I would use a method similar to Passage 2. In classes that I needed to grasp the concepts in, not necessarily memorize details, I would also use something similar to Passage 2 to map out, in my head or on paper, how each concept relates to another. I believe this is extremely helpful because a lot of concepts need to be understood fully to apply them when taking an exam or working on higher level ideas within that course. ","Passage 1 is more helpful when it comes to content based classes; an example would be biology, a subject I used the formatting in passage 1 for studying before. Passage 2 would be more useful in humanities and concept based classes; I've used a format similar in my creative writing class, and it helped me brainstorm ideas. I don't see Passage 2 being useful to effectively study, but it can be useful to expand on knowledge one already has a grasp of.","Answering this based on my written scores, it would be reasonable to assume that neither of these formats would be beneficial to my learning. However, in an academic environment, as I've stated before, I've used variations of these formats for different courses and have been successful. Personally I'd prefer the format for Passage 1 as the simplicity makes me more likely to find all the answers I need, organized and clearly. This is further evident by my test scores for Passage 1, which never changed because I found that they were clearly stated and easy to find IF I just read through each paragraph of text. On the contrary, Passage 2 didn't contain any paragraphs, and barely any sentences. The ""map"" was all over the place, still within reason of course but nonetheless terrifying to look at and overwhelming at the beginning. Eventually I realized due to the ""spacey-ness"" of the text, I could locate the answers rather easily without reading much of anything. I feel as though my brain had to make a lot of connections with the story after I had located the answers and finished with the quiz. When I was writing the written response, I used all these isolated pieces of information I had quickly grasped onto and formatted them to fit logically together--I still didn't understand major parts of the story, and missed others all-together, and so my understanding was flawed in a major way. Thus I'm saying that Passage 2 made me ""lazy"" and ""exhausted"" mentally, and that's why I don't believe it will be good for me academically, in hindsight. As for Passage 1, it would required a lot of reading and rereading to cement those details in my mind, as I can easily discard or miss certain things due to the size of the paragraphs. The main idea I could grasp, but any other details--such as Christine Craft's name that I failed to remember each and every time--would escape me. "

In such a style, the author used a lot of arrows to illustrate the relationships of the content in the passage. It's way more clear and more direct for me to read due to I can have a logical chain in my mind about what is it about. Another reason why I like passage 2 better is that I can find what I want to know very quickly by following the logical chain. 

Passage 1 also uses some arrows, but it's not that useful for me. The arrow in passage 1 is used for connecting paragraphs, so I still need to read the entire paragraph to understand the relationships and find what I need. But passage 1 gives me a better reading experience indeed.","I feel that both these two formats of the articles bring me good memorization. I can remember more stuff from the first format, especially some close relations and reasoning stuff because I was reading complete paragraphs. However, the second format enables me to remember more logical stuff and I was trying to visualize the picture of that mindmap to recall details. To sum up, more detail was recalled from the second format, but more relations and reasoning were recalled from the first format.","I think that the format of passage 1 is easier to read because it's is divided into paragraphs but not single words or sentences. In that format, I can catch the logical relations in a sub-topic of the article more fluently. And I can also understand the purpose of why the author wrote it more quickly. However, the second passage's format is too ""separated"" for me. I can not understand what does the author write about or his/her goal. Although the logical chains may be easier to analyze in the second format, it does not bring me a good reading experience."

As the result, I may have a deeper understanding and memory of the paragraphs that I read. However, for the second format. I would say it may be helpful for somebody but not me.

When she goes she is very impressed by the ballet and her son thinks she doesn't like it because she doesn't say anything but they she starts to cry and tell him she loved it and hugs her. she also feels a sense of relation to cinderella because her poor background also made her an outcast in a sense.

Passage one is easier to read because everything flows more smoothly as it is in complete sentences but there is a lot of information that can be overwhelming to see all at once and make me lost at times. Passage 2 is confusing in its organization but the limited amount of information makes it easier to take it all in and understand it. ,I find that both were helpful for remembering information. the first because it was easier to read and the second because there was less overall information so easier to take it in. ,the first one was easier to read and so i spent less time trying to understand the format and being able to learn the information. the second one because there was less filler information and just the key word were present it make it easier to take in information.

Someone who is too pleasing or displeasing can be seen as untrustworthy. Television news has become a form of entertainment.

The passage summarized the experience by stating that news, which is consumed over television, serves more as entertainment, rather than a full dissemination of information, due to the fact that people gauge the reliability of the news by how pleasing the face of the presenter is to them. The people who present the news must not be distractingly beautiful, but also not ugly, and thus the ideas that are presented on TV are judged as being more or less reliable based on who is presenting them.

Also, it was more legible. ","Passage one had information that was presented in big blocks of text, which made it difficult to focus on individual sections. While passage 2 was also difficult to navigate, it had categories which could be explored. The categories made it easier to remember what the focus of the passage was, unlike passage one, which presented everything all at once.","When it comes to ease of readability, I think being presented with these two passages in the broken down format first made it so I spent most of the time trying to understand how the passages were interconnected, rather than the content of the text. However, I do think that the text that connected the Reena passage (i.e. words such as ""which led to"" or ""so she was"") made the relationships between the nodes easier to visualize. I found the first passage harder to read than the second as it presented the information in larger chunks, which relied on me to produce the connections which were displayed in the Reena passage via the connective text.

As stated previously, passage 1 presents more information with less connective statements, which relies on the reader to create. If the reader doesn't make the connections that the text intends to create, the visualization of that information is more difficult to retain.

The first one was about the guy and talked about how critics view him as hypocritical because on one hand he is for preserving the life of animals and pandas but he also advocates for zoos which critics dont like. He also talks about a moment where he is with a panda and the mother leaves her baby panda with him implying that this panda trust him and this experience is very close to him. He talks about the importance of Pandas back in the day with negoitating with other nations. The panda symbolizes something good. I also recall him talking about making a new panda enclosure that resembles the old one but provides something where visitors can experience things that the pandas like. There was also something about Yin and YAng,,c,c,a,b,c,b,a,c,,,Mon May 09 2022 13:48:54 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),8,1,894,Thu May 12 2022 13:14:46 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),9,0.225,0.5368746384724636,Thu May 12 2022 13:09:43 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),299,I remember it was about a man who cared much about pandas and discussed how he had critics that called him hypocritical because on one end he was for preserving animals so that they dont go extinct but he also was an advocate for pandas to be in a zoo enclosure. This was not any ordinary enclosure as it was built with many amnenities for the panda so that it was comfortable. He also talked about a moment where he was with this panda and the panda left her baby panda with him and it was a very joyful moment for him because the panda trusted him with her baby. Also there was a passage about how a panda was looked up to by the chinese when negoitations took place back in the day.

Critics said his work was hypocritical because on one end he advocated for preserving animals lifetime but also was an advocate for keeping pandas in a zoo. But actually the enclosure he had built was very good for the panda and had many amnenities in it. This passage talked about a memory he had in which a momma panda left her baby panda with him and he felt very joyful. It also talked about how pandas symbolizes something good to the Chinese back a few hundred years ago when there was negotations. ,,a,c,a,b,c,b,a,c,,,Mon May 16 2022 13:13:24 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),7,0.875,72,H2,Mon May 09 2022 13:51:59 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),Mon May 09 2022 13:49:42 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),H2,Thu May 12 2022 13:25:31 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),,H2,Mon May 16 2022 13:19:52 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),Mon May 16 2022 13:15:10 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),I would say that i find passage two more helpful because it was easier to distinguish one from another.,"I think my answer to the question before answered this one but I am used to reading information in paragraphs because that is what i was taught. Especially when each paragraph discusses one topic it makes it more easier to understand. For example, one paragraph just talked about why the panda was important to the Chinese while another paragraph talked about a memory that the guy had about the panda.",I find this helpful for my academic learning because i always seemed to do better when the information was in paragraphs. It is easier to understand because the information is clear and concise. As my scores indicate i did very poor on the owl passage and very well on the paragraph format.
