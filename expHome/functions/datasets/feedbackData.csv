ANU ZAN,K2,1. Can easily see keys words that are related to the question. 2. Shorter and concise,Both,the first format could be used as transition to the second format. The second format require a minimum of analyzing skills,K2,the story was more comprehensive and had a better understanding. ,K2,I had a easy understanding because the title of the nodes shows what the text will speak about. ,,,,
Adeen Izzathullah,Both,"In the first one, there was less flipping back and forth because each section had more information. In the second one, it was quicker to read and flowed better.",H2,More information in each section that is easy to reference,H2,The information was better presented and organized,H2,More organized; more information in each section made it easier to digest.,,,,
Ajinkya Bhanudas Dessai,H2,Lower cognitive load i.e. I was scrambling to get a sense of the situation and the arrows/flow markers made it difficult to piece information together.,H2,"As a learner, I tend to need more context before I frame a situation in my head. I'm a visual learner, so when I read a paragraph it's stuff that I'm imagining that helps me remember. The smaller text blocks deprive from of that understanding. Also I believe there is some merit to a Horizontal flowing chart over a vertical one as that seemed to make me more comfortable.",H2,"Longer chunks allowed me to create a visual that helped me build context while i was reading. Scientific concepts are difficult for me to remember when I don't have an idea of it's purpose of application i.e. I am reading facts about the ant but have no idea of the relative importance of the links. The second passage on the other hand and a lot of filler language that let me piece things together. On second thought, I suspect that I might do better if there were shorter chunks for the ""The Quiet Sideman"" and longer chunks for the ""The Jaws That Jump"" to help me answer better. ",H2,"I think that byte-sized information like in passage 1 would be of greater help if I have a moderate grasp over the concept. E.g. I struggled to make sense of some of the terminologies in passage 1 and had no clue on how to associate one part to another even with the presence of links. In passage 2 however, the context was free of background knowledge or jargons that would block me from making all of it into a cohesive story to bear in mind. If I was revising, I'd go with passage1, If I was learning, it would be passage2. ",,,,
Alexis Ma,H2,"Attention was spent trying to understand the flow of the chart for the first passage as opposed to the second, which appeared more straightforward.",H2,The second passage was much easier to comprehend and took much less time to read.,H2,I prefer more condensed readings. Webs can be a little bit confusing if not created by myself. ,H2,"Again, more straightforward and organized in a way that makes sense to me.",,,,
Alicia Lee,H2,Because there were more specific information about the topic than passage 1. ,K2,"In the passage 1, the necessary knowledge is easily listed. ",K2,"It was very simple to read, and very easy to follow. ",K2, It was more helpful because it seemed like a collection of important information. ,,,,
Alyssa McKinney,Both,"For quicker information such as definitions, connecting ideas, and so on I think the first one was much easier to read. For more detailed stories, ideas, and so on I think the second one was easier to read. So depending on the category I think both are great.",K2,More so the first because it seemed quicker to find what I was looking for versus reading a whole paragraph to find one line of information.,K2,"the information was more memorable in pieces, and divided into categories.",K2,"The format allows for memorable definitions, connecting ideas, and explanations for certain points.",,,,
Amanda Abokhair,H2,The paragraph structure was easier to follow. Having more information in one place made it easier to navigate as well.,Both,"Both of them taught me what I needed to know in order to answer the questions. The navigation of each was different, but I learned the same amount from both.",H2,The paragraphs made it easier to follow information and understand.,Both,"Both formats gave me the information I needed and I was able to learn from both of them. Even if I found one easier to read, it was still easy to understand both.",,,,
Amelia Henriques,K2,"Passage 1 broke information down into very small pieces, while Passage 2 presented the information in chunks, rather than individual interrelated pieces.",K2,"When reading Passage 1, it was easier to find the information required for the questions asked during that task. When reading Passage 2, I felt as though I had to read through the entire paragraph a few times to find the exact right piece of information I was looking for.",K2,"It broke the information down in a very granular way, where instead of each node containing like 6-7 pieces of information, each node was it's own piece of information.",K2,"Since Passage 2 was so complicated, my written score ended up going down today, compared to my Passage 1 written score, which went slightly up today.",,,,
Amelia Ostrow,H2,"Passage 1 felt more like an outline than an actual passage because, while all the content and connections were there, it wasn't the easiest to understand from the get-go. Passage 2 was broken up enough that it was easy to read, and I didn't have to spend as much time understanding the format.",Both,"I think they would be good at different aspects of learning. Passage 2 would probably be better to begin with because the connections are more clearly laid out and it was more descriptive, but Passage 1's format would be significantly more helpful as a summary or review of content already learned.",H2,"The format of the second passage made it so that I wasn't confused by what information I was trying to receive because the complete sentences outlined everything clearly. When reading the first passage, I had to spend quite a bit of time figuring out how to read it as a structure before the test, and once I got to the test, it still took me a bit to figure out how to read it.",K2,"I felt like I knew the facts from Passage 1 better than the facts from Passage 2. The multiple choice scores don't really illustrate that point, but the written response score do, especially considering I scored better for Passage 1 the second time around. I may have remembered that information better because I spent a lot longer with the passage, trying to figure out what I should be taking from it, but the subject matter of the first passage was also much more interesting to me than the second.",,,,
Amelia Spann,K2,Smaller pieces of information spaced out with relationships listed was easier to scan and understand quickly.,Both,I think my reference might be different depending on the material or discipline.,H2,"Passage one offered more contextual information that I could refer to for easier recall, I think.  However, the second passage was easier to scan through quickly, but I think that resulted in me no thinking about it as much.",Both,I think I would use each format depending on the stage I'm in for studying or depending on the material or topic and how well it lends itself to more granular sections.,,,,
Amrit Pradhan,H2,Passage 2 was a lot easier to follow and understand. I felt like I would sometimes get lost in Passage 1 because of the amount of boxes and arrows. I felt like I learned and understood a lot more from Passage 2 than I did in Passage 1.,H2,"I feel like dividing information into concise chunks of text is a lot more beneficial for my academic learning than having a huge web of information. It was much easier to follow Passage 2. In addition, I think Passage 2 did a better job of explaining the information because the explanation was included in the same chunk of text while in Passage 1 I had to follow the arrows and look for the explanation. Passage 1 also didn't go into as much depth as Passage 2.",H2,"Passage 1 was easy to get lost in because of the amount of arrows and boxes. At times it could be difficult to follow the web of information. Passage 2 however was broken up into chunks of information, making it much easier to follow and understand.",H2,"Passage 1 seemed to give the bare bones of the article and not much explanation. I didn't feel like I understood why things that the article mentioned were happening. On the other hand, since Passage 2 was broken down into chunks of information that explained the topic of each chunk, I was able to learn a lot more. Thus, Passage 2 would be much more beneficial for my academic learning than Passage 1.",,,,
Andrew Chen,H2,I can find the information on one page in passage 2.,H2,It's more clear and less energy-consuming.,H2,"It has all information arranged in one page, we can easily find all of the information. Also, we don't need to click the links repeatedly, which is very energy-consuming for me. ",H2,"Although it looks less professional, it helps me to understand the whole structure better.",,,,
Annalisse Thompson,K2,"Passage 2 was a bit easier because it allowed you to go deeper into each part rather than having a big paragraph. However, both are difficult to read and follow.",K2,I found passage 2 more helpful because it was easier to maneuver. Passage 1 seemed a bit overwhelming. ,K2,I preferred how it went into detail rather than having large passages about a general topic.,K2,I believe it is the most helpful because it went into detail about many topics rather than having a large summary about one topic.,,,,
Anuya Karnik,K2,,H2,,K2,,Both,,,,,
Ardrian Sethra Tidwell,H2,"Mainly, passage one, by having all of the information on a single page made it easier to interconnect said information mentally. Passage 2 required clicking to and fro, which made the information very disconnected, physically and mentally.",H2,"For learning purposes, it's generally easier for me to remember things if they're easy to interpret. In this case, Passage 1 was just more cohesive to me.",H2,The first one had less clicking or scrolling to do in order to access the content. It also required me to move my eyes less to view the material.,H2,"Passage 1 had the information broken up by topics, which made it easier to digest the topic. Passage 2 was more difficult because I needed to more thoroughly cognate on what the relationship graph was supposed to mean, and interpreting was a bit more difficult than the subject-by-subject approach.",,,,
Arthur Cho Ka Wai,H2,"When I saw the question, i would form incomplete phrases in my head and try to find the fillers, representations in passage 2 was easier for me to gather pieces of information in attempt to fill in the blanks",H2,"The representation of passage 2 allows me to comprehend and process information with grouped, connected concepts in a more linear way.",H2,it has higher test scores and written response score.,Both,the style of passage 1 helps when it come to studies that require deeply looking at relationships between the different subjects and answer very specific question that can be found directly in the graph. while passage 2 is easier for me to understand the full pictures of the context.,,,,
Asia Luboyeski,H2,All of the information was laid out in one page and I didn't have to click between multiple pages. I could also read the information quicker and not jump around,H2,"I'm used to passages as opposed to webs of information. In passage one, sentences/facts were broken up over different circles and I had to keep going between different pages to find the information. There was a much clearer format in passage 2",H2,I thought passage 2 was easier to read because the ideas were all together in sentences/the passages instead of being broken up across a web. I feel that I was able to get a bit more of the complete picture of the concepts in passage 2 since I understood more of a story. ,H2,"I think passage 2's knowledge representation formats is most helpful for my academic learning because jumping around a concept web is distracting and makes it hard to focus on everything. In passage 2, I was able to remember things in each specific box whereas in passage 1, I remembers things in certain boxes but they had few words instead of full concepts. ",,,,
Baobao Li,H2,"I thought passage 2 was easier to read, because all of the information was laid out on one page. In passage 1, there were seven tabs I had to navigate through, and it was unclear to me where the information that the questions were asking would be located precisely. I remember having to click through each of the tabs sometimes to find the answers to each question. ",K2,"I think that passage 1 was more suited for academic learning, because the information was laid out in pieces rather than in paragraph form. In comparison, passage 2 was better suited for answering multiple choice questions. I think that passage 1 would be more helpful for learning each of the concepts in a way that was better than the second passage.",H2,"I think passage 2 was easier to read, because all the information was laid out onto one page rather than through many pages in the first passage. It was also easier to find the answers to the multiple choice questions, and it was apparent that I did better on both the multiple choice and the written response for passage 2.",H2,"Judging by my test scores, they seem around equal for longer term memorization. However, passage 2 seems to have helped me learn more of the information than passage 1 did, judging by my overall scores for both the multiple choice section and the free response section.",,,,
Benjamin Brown,H2,"First, I did not realize the different sections of passage 2 could be expanded, even though it said link I did not think to put my cursor over it. Second, in my academic background I am used to skimming for information, passage 1 is more or less just one page, passage 2 requires multiple clicks to navigate and requires back tracking if information cannot be found. ",K2,"Passage 2 is better for initial research, comperable to using an encyclopedia or reference work.  ",H2,"I am used to reading and skimming longer written passages, and the content was easier to understand. Also I failed to realize that the different portions of passage 2 could be expanded until a decent amount of time had passed. ",K2,The ability to rapidly identify and expand upon individual pieces of information from a larger body can be very useful in initial research. ,,,,
Blythe Terry,H2,"Switching between pages could be slightly disorienting in Passage 2, whereas Passage 1 was all on one page",Both,I think both presented information in an engaging way. Sort of made reading like a game.,H2,It was simply easier to navigate but I don't think that makes it better than any other,Both,I think depending on the content one might be more useful than the other. I think passage 2 was sucessful at covering a lot of different suptopics while passage 1 really homed in on one main idea.,,,,
Bronya Sandorffy,K2,"It was much easier to skim quickly for information, as opposed to the second one, which required a lot more reading.",K2,"Since it's easier to read, it's a lot easier to digest the information that one might need for their academic learning.",K2,I thought passage 1 was easier to read because the information was broken up into smaller chunks. Passage 2 had much longer sentences and paragraphs that were harder to digest quickly.,K2,"As a student, it's hard to make time to spend a long time reading paragraphs and try to really learn from them. I like having the information I read in smaller to digest pieces because it's a lot quicker and requires less mental energy. I also have limited time to read assignments for school, since I have a lot going on, so quicker is always better. ",,,,
Carson James Clark,H2,The information was more readily accessible in passage 1 then passage 2. It didn't make you go through several different concept maps to acquire all the necessary information.,H2,"Passage 1 included more detailed descriptions of important concepts, which made it easier for me to understand the topic.",K2,"The text was simpler, more spaced apart, and summarized the most important points.",H2,"Although it is more complicated then Passage 2's format, it provided more detail and better descriptions, which is better for me personally when I am learning something new.",,,,
Catherine Grillo,H2,I find it easier to read sentences/paragraphs and then connect them rather than just phrases and words,H2,It was easier to navigate and remember what I was reading because I could take in a chunk of information at a time rather than having to move around the page a lot just to read a few words at a time,H2,It's easier for me to take in information when it is in complete sentences or chunks rather than short phrases,H2,"I feel like it was easier to recall information from the second passage rather than the first, and I can remember sentences better than associations like in the first passage.",,,,
Catherine Kung,H2,"There wasn't that much of a difference since they both require a skim read and a general understanding of where certain pieces of information are located. However, in terms of finding an answer where I don't know the location of, I found the second one to be easier just because the paragraph nature of it forced me to finish reading and understand the entire node before moving on to the next one, while for the first one because I am more looking for particular wording to answer question I don't fully register what it is saying and end up spending more time flipping through the links",Both,"I think it depends on what the end goal is, if someone wants a quick crash-course overview on a subject, then the first passage definitely helps, but if the goal is to have a deeper understanding, I think I'll go with the second option",H2,"I still think passage 2 was easier as the whole paragraph structure forced me to read through the entire parts rather than skimming through the graph to find individual words. Compared to paragraph 1, where the only things I remember are things related with the questions asked (which were put in paragraphs/full sentences), I have a more holistic view on paragraph 2",Both,"I still think that it really depends on what the ends goal is, if the end goal is to create flashcards to remind myself of what I already learned/read, and or make it easier for people to find the information they are specifically looking for, then paragraph 1 might be better. Otherwise, if the end goal is have a holistic understanding or learn thoroughly about a subject, then passage 2 is better.",,,,
Chengtian Zhang,H2,"Passage 2 is confusing me in some way because it has too many pages, a little hard to locate information.",H2,,H2,,H2,,,,,
Chiara Casiglia,H2,The organization of the information was easier to follow in passage 2 because each node contained full and complete ideas unlike the first passage that broke up the information too much. Passage 2 was also easier to navigate and find information I was looking for.,H2,"Passage 2 more clearly explained the ideas it was trying to convey. It was easier to follow and see how different concepts connected. Also, the more linear organization of passage 2 made it easier to see the progression of ides and it was easier to refer back to it when I couldn't remember something.",H2,The organization of the information in passage 2 was easier to follow.,H2,The information was more linear and therefore easier to retain and make sense of.,,,,
Christina Lin,K2,Less massive paragraphs and divided into nodes with labels that directed you to the topic you needed to recall the quickest,K2,Because it's good for brevity and more concise as opposed to reading long paragraphs in a textbook,K2,"Less paragraphs, easier to read and easier for the eyes",K2,I think textbooks tend to have too much information crammed into one page and you get bored reading so much,,,,
Daniela Zubillaga,H2,It summarized the information under one topic. Less navigation which made keeping track of information easier as well. ,H2,"Because it explains the topic in a summarized way, and clearly delineates the subtopics and their purposes to the main study. ",H2,The format presented the information in a more cohesive way. The less use of navigation makes for information to be recalled much more easily than having to navigate to many different sections. ,H2,"This is a more traditional format, but its use of subtitles and summarization provides a very easy way to recall information. The way the information is placed helps with memorization. Since the information is labelled by a broader subtitle, one is able to go back effectively and locate the information more easily. ",,,,
Debora Tolessa,H2,"Maybe it is a personal preference, but I have always found it easier to understand textual representation than pictorials",H2,It was easier for me to follow and find details.,H2,I prefer words than maps and imagery,H2,I think that that is the style I prefer naturally,,,,
Delaney Riddering,H2,Passage 2 involved separate pages to sort through whereas passage 1 included all information on a single page,H2,This format separates information into categories with headers that can be easily located when answering questions,H2,"There were less pages to flip through, information was more compact under each header",H2,It is easy to find information under a few descriptive headers rather than reading through a text document.,,,,
Dylan Brian McElroy,H2,Passage 2 explained the question in the context of a person's history. Passage 2 for me is less difficult then going through the scientific fields of a particular ant species.,Both,"Passage 1 and Passage 2, while they use a different set of learning skills, both explain the context as well as various aspects of the subjects.",H2,It gives more historical context for the subject.,H2,I understand passage 2 better and it is harder to focus on passage 1,,,,
Enna Castro,H2,It was straight forward ,H2,"It was easier to red, and I wasn't reading all over the place",H2,I didn't have to go back and forth to read and it was straight forward ,H2,"Because I could just read it straight and like I mentioned before, I didn't have to go back and forth ",,,,
Erin Utter,H2,I thought that passage 1 was easier to read because the information in the second passage was split up too many times and it also required me to remember things from other pages in order to understand the context.,H2,It was easier for me to retain information from Passage 1 than from Passage 2.,H2,I think that the first passage was easier to read because the information seemed more clearly connected so it was easier to process and understand.,H2,The first passage was more helpful for learning because I was able to understand and remember it better.,,,,
Esha Patel,H2,I believe the first passage was easier to understand because all the information was laid out into mini passages which made it easier to skim through. The second passage however had each word broken down which took more time to understand the reading. You also had to keep going back and forth in the 2nd passage while in the first passage everything was displayed from the start. ,H2,The first passage was the most helpful for an academic learning because I liked the formatting of mini passages. I also prefer my information laid all out from the start on a single page. This makes remembering the information easier and more effectively. ,H2,"The first passage representation was a lot easier to understand because of the paragraph formatting. However, I surprisingly did better on the second graph representation which I found harder to process because of the breakdown into one word. ",K2,The second representation is helpful in my academic learning because even though each word from a larger reading was broken down it made it easier to process and understand. I was able to remember the answers without going back to the reading. ,,,,
Evan Zane Hitsky,H2,"Information wasn't seperated, didn't need to flip through multiple pages to find information",H2,"Easier/quicker to read, more condensed, more organized and accessible. It was much easier to visualize the information when it was all contained within one tree.",H2,"Since everything was connected, instead of seperated into several pages, it was easier to follow along with",Both,"I think that the first approach has its own merits for specific circumstances, but overall the second could be a very useful tool for students more geared towards visual learning, as it presents the information in a unique way that illustrates the connectiosn between them",,,,
Everette Crudup,K2,I believe that the second representation was broken up by key points; which allowed me to scan the information more efficiently.,K2,I found that knowledge representation 2 is best for me because I have adhd and reading large blocks of information can be overwhelming and anxiety provoking. The outlined format allowed for me to locate key information with ease; once I realized how it worked.,K2,The information format featured a main point hierarchy. This made finding critical information easy and effective.,K2,I believe the second format is great for academic learning because it accommodates a wider audience of learning and information processing styles.,,,,
Francisco Mora,K2,"Because it was easier to identify what I am looking for, since it was a couple of words compared to the longer passages, in which I got a bit overwhelmed and lost.",K2,"Because it was more straight forward and simpler, and it took less time to read and easier to understand.",K2,"I thought it was easier to read because the wording was shorter, and simpler compared to Passage 1 where there were long paragraphs where there was almost too much information.",K2,"I think because it was faster to be able to absorb more information, providing key elements to the passage.",,,,
Gabrielle Calabrese,H2,"I think passage one was easier because all the information was directly connected to one another, where as in passage 2 I had to click on several links and sort through the links to find the answer I was looking for. A pro of Passage 2 though was that there was less reading and more direct with the questions pertaining to the passage.",Both,"Personally, I love reading so I don't mind passage 1, especially since all the information was connected to one another. However, reading less and still being able to find the answer by posing the question as the topic category was definitely beneficial and something I would enjoy when studying. ",Both,"Passage 1 was easier to read in the sense that I was better able to discuss the topic that I read and recall the information for the writing part. However, Passage 2 was easier to recall when asked direct multiple choice questions.",Both,"I think there are pros and cons to both formats. Format one was easier to navigate for me, since I didn't have to click on as many links to see the next section of information. Plus Passage 1 had complete sentences. However, when responding to multiple choice questions, it was easier to recall the short format of the presented information in Passage 2.",,,,
Ge Zhang,H2,I believe it's more easy for me to have a major topic for a paragraph and I can check the logic relationship of the sentences in the paragraph by my own. Having too much relationship description makes kind of confused.,K2,Good note if I carefully read the paragraph before.,H2,I think that it's more easy for me to directly get needed information from paragraphs given main topic. The format of passage 1 made me kind of confused.,K2,"I'm not good at academic writing. But in my belief, if there are enough time, the clear definition of the knowledge graph can help.",,,,
Grace Dwyer,K2,Each page of information was easier to skim through because there weren't paragraphs of text that I had to read. The shorter phrases allowed easier manuvering throughout.,Both,"I think a combination of the two would be the best. Although the shorter phrases in passage two made the content easier to navigate, often it was more difficult to grasp understanding from each individual box/node. Perhaps having the formate of several pages and many smaller boxes/nodes but some more descriptive boxes lower on the hierarchy that contain a sentence or two of descriptive information.",K2,"I think the quiet sideman was easier to read beacuse the information was broken up first into groups based on the content and timeline and then into much smaller nodes that each had a small piece of information on each. However, sometime the nodes were too small of a chunk which made it difficult to grasp the bigger picture in some situations. ",H2,"The main reason I chose the Jaws that Jump was simply the amount of content I had to learn about. While the paragraphs were large and cumbersome at times, it still made it easier to understand the information I was expected to learn and retain it for a longer time. More of the smaller details stuck with me, whereas in the other passage I found much of the important details slip thorugh the cracks.",,,,
Grace Ramstad,K2,It was easier to search for specific information without having to read a whole paragraph to find one piece of information.,K2,"I am able to seek out the specific information I want to learn about, without getting as tired out from digging through information I am not interested in.",K2,"I was able to go through the map more quickly looking for the information I wanted, rather than having to dig through a whole paragraph to find one piece of information. It also did not feel so tiring to follow a path of small chunks of words compared to long paragraphs. ",K2,It kept me more easily engaged because it was not so taxing to read through. I could easily hunt for an answer to a question or explore a single topic of interest.,,,,
Hanna Duncan,H2,It was easier to access the information,H2,Was organized clearer for me and written out more,H2,All the information was in 1 map. It was confusing to go through different webs and connect the data with little content like the second passage had.,H2,"It has content in each bubble; however, the information was not too long or too short. The information in passage 2 was too vague. ",,,,
Hannah Pless,H2,I prefered the second format (The one about music) because it reminded me of the nodes we work with. That was a sense of familiar and it was more to the point. I did not have to click on any links or there was not as much scrolling and stalling.  ,K2,I feel the first format (The one about owls) was probably the most useful to me considering I have taken biology. ,H2,"Passage two was my favorite. I felt it was clean, concise, and to the point. There was no information overload, and I enjoyed the story like following. I was kept engaged and felt I better understood the material. ",H2,"It was clean, concise and easy to follow. I never lost attention and found the format easy to follow. It was all laid out for me and simple to read.  ",,,,
Hannah Ryniak,H2,"more explanations, greater detail",H2,"more explanations, greater detail",H2,"more detailed, not as many links to click, easier to remember",H2,"more detailed, #2 had multiple links and shorter bits of info, making it hard to remember for me",,,,
Heather Bigeloq,H2,It held more concrete information. Passage 2 was very drawn out and had to many opportunities to click on for information. The only thing I would say about Passage 1 is that it had a lot of filler information. It could have been cut down on and summarized more concisely.,H2,"Again, I feel like the first one was easier to find and retain the information than the second one. While the second one was more concise, it had too many links to click on for more information. ",,,,,,,,
HeeJoo Roh,H2,"The second passage was too granular, and I didn't know which sections to look through due to my lack of knowledge of the subject. The first passag was also easier to look through, because I didn't have to click to a separate page to realize what the node is about. ",H2,"It's easier to organize concepts in chunks, rather than in very granular words. ",H2,There were less links to click through and move around. It's easier to have the information on the same page.,H2,"There are less steps to get to the answer I am looking for, and the second passage, to get to the section that I am looking for, required some base knowledge to know where to look.",,,,
Heidi Dargle,H2,I felt like it was easier to follow and find information.,H2,It provides a little more detailed information rather than having to figure it out through bubbles like in passage one.,H2,"I feel like it was easier to read because the sentences were already formed for me, rather than me having to figure it out. Although I seem to remember the first passage more, I still think the second one was easier to read.",Both,"I think both are pretty good, the information is there and easy to take away, I learned more from passage one, but I think it might be because I thought it was more interesting. I think the second passage was easier to follow, but the first passage makes it sort of fun to go through and more interactive.",,,,
Hyerim Seo,Neither,I'm not used to reading either of the two formats and it was confusing to navigate myself but I think passage 2 was slightly easier to follow,Neither,I personally don't find either of them helpful for my academic learning but I think some people will find one or the other helpful for learning,H2,It was easy for me to navigate through the passage 2 whereas for passage 1 things were all over the places and I was very stressed about where to look at,H2,The first format would have been helpful if it wasn't different shapes and arrows all over the place but the second passage was more straight forward so my brain could focus better,,,,
Hyo Hong,H2,I didn't have to toggle back and forth as often to understand each subtopic thoroughly.,Both,"Although more difficult to follow in the beginning, Passage 1's format is easier to summarize and probably will be easier to use when studying.",H2,Passage 1 is easier to use when you know which topic/subtopic you're looking for. Passage 2 is just easier to read because my brain processes paragraphs with more ease.,Both,"As previously explained, Passage 1 is useful when knowing exactly which subtopic you're looking for. Honestly would be best for studying/cramming. Passage 2 is easier for leisurely reading/learning.",,,,
Jack Barron,H2,"Easier to maneuver between information, flows better, there are not many breaks so its easy to read, more depth rather than a few words. Category breakdown felt more natural ",H2,"Its more of a structured natural listing of information, where you can read and digest it the other one breaks information into too finite of a form where its difficult to digest and recall and can be difficult and confusing to leap between subjects",H2,"Less movement, do not get lost in the pages as much, flow is not as choppy, easy to retain more information than less",H2,"We traditionally learn more in paragraphs, cutting up a sentence into individual words prevents depth filled learning and also is harder to remember less content, plus content is more easily grouped in the second method ",,,,
Jahyun Koo,H2,Passage 2 had more concise format.

And the initial lack of clarity in passage 1 allows me to spend more time understanding its logic, which may help me remember it better.",H2,The information in the first passage was too fragmented for me to understand the relationships among different pieces of information and the whole picture.,Both,"According to the test scores on the multiple choice questions, my understanding of the two passages don't differ greatly. My memory of the first passage is slightly better than the second, but both scores are fairly low (although I don't have knowledge of the average scores). As I predicted at first, I might have better memory of the information in the first passage because I spent more time and energy trying to understand the logic and big picture, but the effort in the beginning was great and didn't lead to a great learning experience. So the two representation formats have their respective pros and cons.",,,,
Sofia Diaz,H2,"I am a musician; I had more prior knowledge on the first topic. I don't know much about barn owls, so it was harder to answer the questions on a topic that I knew less about going into the experiment.",K2,"It was easier with less information coming at me at once; it was more condensed and broken down rather than a huge paragraph all at once. It can get overwhelming when there is a lot of information at once rather than breaking the information and concepts down, step by step. ",K2,Passage 1 was less paragraphs and more concepts broken down into logical pieces - passage 1 was thus less overwhelming to digest and learn from than passage 2 ,K2,"This passage was broken down into concepts in the mind map, rather than throwing a bunch of information at the reader all at once. This was more helpful to my learning in that I could more easily retain the information. ",,,,
Stephanie Sandoval,K2,"Shorter descriptions. Information was broken down more, which made it easier to read and understand.",Both,I liked passage 1 because it was on one screen. I liked passage 2 because it was much more concise. ,K2,The Quiet Sideman was easier to read because it had short descriptions within each node. ,Both,"Passage 1 is helpful in the sense that it's all one screen, but Passage 2 is helpful because it is less wordy. ",,,,
Tamanna Aujla,K2,Short and straight to the point whereas passage 2 had chunks/paragraphs to read. ,H2,Passage 2 contained much more information in the paragraphs whereas passage 1 was similar to summarized/concise bullet points in which you had to draw connections yourself. ,,,,,,,,
Therese Streeter,H2,The information was easier to process without reading several times due to the more condensed material format,H2,Passage 2 was overall easier to read and comprehend,H2,"I think that having the information in helpful paragraphs assisted me in comprehending/remembering the material better. I also found the subject material of the second passage slightly more interesting, which likely made it a bit easier to read. ",Both,"I think that both passages were arguably helpful, but in different ways. The first passage enabled me to remember smaller pieces of information more effectively, such as the ants comparison to popcorn or the deceleration of their mandibles/jaws. However, passage 2 enabled me to remember items as a group or a category, one leading to the next. (E.g. Remembering Berry's first mentioned song made me remember the last mentioned song of his as well, etc.).",,,,
Tiana Issa,Neither,"Passage 1 was odd because it didn't really have an order to read in but the transitions made it difficult to follow as a plain flow-chat. Meanwhile, Passage 2 had long block texts that were easy to read once I zoomed in but painful to read as it's a block.",K2,"If I was looking for a quick answer, I'd look through Passage 1. Once I got through all of it, it was pretty easy to find the information I needed. It's also more appealing than the block text.",Neither,"The structure of the first passage made it easier to remember the details but actually reading the words was difficult. In passage 2, it had such blocky text with no breaks that I barely remembered anything and it was boring to read.",K2,"As mentioned earlier, all the main points had their own box and it made it easier to remember. But if you were actually read the passage like a full sentence, it's odd.",,,,
Vatsal Chaudhari,K2,Passage 1 was easier to read because the nodes were concise and easier to understand.,K2,Passage 1 was easier to learn from because it was easier to read and understand in a short period of time.,K2,Passage 1 was easier to read because the nodes were more concise than passage 2.,H2,"I think passage 2 was more helpful because I was able to remember more of the information. On the other hand, I mostly skimmed over passage 1 so I did not remember as much.",,,,
Victoria Mulligan,K2,Easier to find relevant information ,K2,Broke down passages in a way that was easy to understand and process compared to paragraphs ,K2,Easier to retain information because it was more organized ,K2,Easier to find the answer in the first passage since it was broken up ,,,,
Victoria Tran,H2,The structure was easier to remember so looking for information seemed easier.,Both,I think passage 1 is nice to divide more specific information out and organize it but passage 2 is good for having a more general overview of a subject.,H2,Passage 1 was more descriptive so it was easier to follow the flow of logic rather than passage 2 where it felt like it was more difficult to understand the flow without the whole context.,Both,I think passage 1 would be useful for understanding new material because it sets up an organizational flow to help learn the material but passage 2 might be more helpful when reviewing material to establish new connections and reflect on already acquired knowledge.,,,,
Vy Nguyen,K2,Less information on one page and easy to read + navigate,Neither,- Passage 1: each node includes many words in one small box --> difficult to read through. - Passage 2: may have to go back and forth to read specific information --> may forget what I just read,K2,,Neither,,,,,

Xinyi Zhao,H2,"The content was organized in several paragraphs that make it easily to be understand. But in passage two, the structure make it more complicated.",H2,The passage 2's structure is too complicated.,Neither,There are many terms that I don't know or hard to understand.,K2,The structure of the content seems clearer.,,,,
Yi Hung,H2,Format of Passage 2 required flipping through multiple folders; was difficult to remember which pieces of information were linked to which heading.,H2,Passage 1 links passages together and explains their relationship to one another. Passage 2 is harder to read because the phrases are broken up.,H2,Passage 1 linked together passages in a way that establishes the relationship between each passage. Passage 2 was more difficult to read because 1) the flowchart design was distracting and 2) it was difficult to remember what information was linked to which heading. ,Neither,"Passage 1 was easier to read, but it was more difficult to retain information. Passage 2 made it easier to recall individual pieces of info, but it was hard to determine their significance and their function in the larger piece.",,,,
Yirong Liang,K2,"tHe second one is mainly the logic connection, and the important point is listed out. Also it illustrate the connection between points. ",Both,"First passage is helping us to train our ability to extract the logic line, second one is helping us understand the content quicker. ",H2,"Passage two contain a lot of small point using lines to connect, but I often forget the connection or ignore them. If I can read a passage, the connections between points leaves more impression.",H2,I think It is easy for the second passage to miss points on the information. We also need to practice how to build the logic net ourselves. ,,,,
Yiyang Guo,H2,I can easily read the whole passage without further clicking the link.,K2,The passage's logic is more clear.,H2,"Same as the first time, I can easily read the whole passage without clicking the link.",K2,The logic is more clear.,,,,
