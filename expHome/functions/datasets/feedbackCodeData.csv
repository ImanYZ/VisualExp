However, after a few minutes, it became a lot more convenient to read and find the answers to the questions presented. As for Passage 2, I also found it easy because it was similar to most of the normal passages I read through every now and then. In short, I think both representations formats are great, especially for Passage 1; if that specific type of representation format was more normalized in most passages, I believe a lot more people would opt for it as well."
