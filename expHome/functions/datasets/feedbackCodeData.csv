While this ease of reading may not be reflected in the test scores, this is likely due to my preference for literature style passages in combination with the fact that this piece of what I assume is fiction was more memorable and novel to me than the information on Panda conservation. As such, the main ideas were remembered more easily. Furthermore, the test questions themselves of passage 2 provided the much needed context clues much of the time and often were actually what helped make sense of the disjointed exposition of passage 2. In fact, without the context clues of the test questions, I am sure that my written responses would have been less detailed. In terms of the written responses, I performed markedly better on the written responses for passage 1 when compared to passage 2. This is likely due to the first passage having the additional context required to better grasp details while the question itself has no context clues to draw on. Thus, perhaps while passage 2's barebones style of presentation may be more conducive to getting across main ideas, passage 1's context paragraph style of presentation is certainly necessary to grasp details and make sense of the picture as a whole, despite the main exposition being more muddy."

I believe that the formatting for passage 2 was more beneficial to my own academic learning because of the chunks of text that it included. The first passage was more divided up and spread out, so retaining quantity was much less likely than it is for the formatting of passage 2. Since the questions were shown with the text, I found myself not reading through every single small box in the story as I simply observed the answers to the questions and moved on. As for the formatting of passage 2, I had to read through every bit of information in order to learn more and find more answers to the questions. For that, I absorbed more information throughout the passage than I did with passage 1. "
