For passage 1, it's too easy for me to pick up the answers just by skimming through the passage. As a result, I cannot recall a lot from the passage. But interestingly enough, it seems like I'm able to remember most of the answers to the multiple choices of passage 1. It's easier to recall provided with memory clues."

With the second passage, while it was faster to read due to shorter sentences and really concise information, having to navigate concept maps, especially across multiple pages, can get a bit confusing. The first passage had more information that felt more easily accessible since I did not have to follow multiple different paths to read information. "

The layout of passage 1 was all one page and involved only a bit of scrolling. All the information in each box was also condensed together rather than having short phrases in each of the boxes.

Passage 1 would be good for things with a lot of content like maybe physics, math, chemistry, etc. Those subjects have a lot of content and organizing it into boxes would make it more organized and make it easier to read/learn. 

Passage 2 would be good for the other academic subjects. All the information is in front of you and it would not be a hassle to try and retrieve that info. I can see this format being helpful for learning a new language because it gives you a path to follow. "

I feel as though I understood Passage 2 again like a picture book, more like a story, in which I was able to understand the flow and structure of the passage better to reproduce a version of it through memory. However, in terms of remembering the specific details, I wonder if I actually retained more of Passage 1. I do feel as though this might have occurred because I did have to reread several aspects of Passage 1 and sift through the information. The higher amount of cognitive effort the passage required perhaps resulted in me learning the ""facts"" and ""answers"" better. For academic learning, I think sometimes both skills are useful in different ways. For impromptu speaking and speech-giving, Passage 2 would probably help me most, while for writing an essay or taking a memorization-based test, Passage 1 might be preferable for me."

I beleive that if the format is more simplistic and all in one page I will be able to spend more time really learning the content. For passage 2 I may remember less because the information was much more spread out and thus I did not remember each part of the pages.
