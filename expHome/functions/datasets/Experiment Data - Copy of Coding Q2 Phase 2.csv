178,Neither,"I have to admit that the first passage included a lot of information, which was helpful. But, I did not sense the cohesion in it. I was trying to understand, I did not understand it lightly. And as a recent Master's graduate, I read a LOT. Usually, it is very easy to read long papers and books. But in this case, it was kind of tiring. Same for the second passage, it was too short that I barely understood what it was about. Maybe, the most helpful format would be a balance between both passages. Not too short, not too long, and with cohesion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My memory of the first passage is slightly better than the second, but both scores are fairly low (although I don't have knowledge of the average scores). As I predicted at first, I might have better memory of the information in the first passage because I spent more time and energy trying to understand the logic and big picture, but the effort in the beginning was great and didn't lead to a great learning experience.

200,Both,"I think that both passages were arguably helpful, but in different ways. The first passage enabled me to remember smaller pieces of information more effectively, such as the ants comparison to popcorn or the deceleration of their mandibles/jaws.
