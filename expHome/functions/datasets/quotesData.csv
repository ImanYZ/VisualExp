" It was also easier to read in my head, since I wasn't constantly stopping, trying to figure out where to read next"
" Instead, this method used text boxes with medium bodies of text to get the message across which is the traditional way I'm used to taking in information/reading"
"While there was more text in passage 2, the condensed information in fewer boxes more effectively separated the information"
" The arrows led directly to the next point, or supplemental information from the last point, and the arrows were labeled with exactly how the two points were connected"
Passage 2 was easier to read because all of the information was compiled in a single page unlike passage 1
Definitely less confusing or intimidating to read through
 The abundance of small subheadings and links in passage 2 made it difficult to find the information I was looking for because it wasn't all in one place
 Thruogh the first passage I could learn in detail about the topioc at hand however in the second passage I could only retain fragments of the actual argument
" With science based courses, or at the very least courses which are very ""content heavy"" and ""memorization based"", Passage 1 would work wonderfully to condense your notes and connect main ideas, further cementing ""chunks"" of information into your brain so they stick"
Passage 1 is helpful for developing critical thinking and literary comprehension/analysis skills and passage 2 is helpful for learning facts about an established concept
The first format contains multiple graphs so that I need to check back and forth often
 The format of keeping everything on the same page definitely prevented more distractions
"Not too many, not too few links allow me to understand the gist of the passage, the main idea of each box of the passage, and the relationship between the boxes through the links"
 Knowledge representation 2 is helpful when we want to know more descriptive information
 The second format is more like a logical approach to a subject that requires accurate and precise information where there are multiple levels of knowledge can be retrieved based on personal interest
 It was also easier for me to see the cause-and-effect relationship and also determine how this specific element is important for another connecting element
 And each graph would have a complicated structure so that there is no fixed or correct order of reading
"Experience from answering questions today supported my feeling from last week about this question, that the format of passage 2 would perhaps be useful in reviewing and note-taking"
 This was especially salient in the literature example where we are no longer able to grasp the perspective of the narrator and the contexts necessary to answer the passage questions
" However, I tried Passage 2's format for a couple of lessons, and I found myself getting overwhelmed and lost"
"

For stories, I find a linear prose-like reading experience to work better as it is visually simpler in prose format; I can scan blocks of text if I need to pick-and-choose certain bits of information"
 Passage 2 required switching back and forth between visuals and this was a bit confusing
 The titles on each of the passages were helpful and the lines connecting each piece of the reading
"This was much easier to read because it did not interrupt my ""flow"" of reading in my head"
" I can't really see this applying to reading because with reading, there are many things that compose the gist of the passage: from sensory details to figurative language"
" In classes that I needed to grasp the concepts in, not necessarily memorize details, I would also use something similar to Passage 2 to map out, in my head or on paper, how each concept relates to another"
" In passage 1, the links did not allow me to smoothly read all the information for efficient comprehension"
The second passage was the easiest to work through visually and condensed information into small but meaningful enough chunks so that ideas flowed naturally in the chart
I think passage 2 was easier to comprehend in total because it was easier to keep track of the details and follow along with the story
 The first one read a little more like a traditional passage that I'm used to seeing but broken up with arrows that showed the relationships between the different paragraphs so I liked that I could easily go back and find the section I wanted
 I could just find the corresponding topic and click on it to get more information
Passage 1 was just more organized and felt like overall less reading
"  With the first passage, the more scattered way of presenting information made it easier to find specific details like why the trap-jaw ants were able to avoid hurting themselves, but it was difficult to follow it as a whole passage"
"I like mind-mapping as a learning technique in general, but passage 2 provided much more information for me because I saw a general overview in the beginning and afterwards I could click on a more specific tab to get more information"
"Passage 1 was easier to read because although it took more pages, it isolated important phrases and your eyes are more drawn to it"
 This format made it easier to create a memory pathway in my mind that I could work backwards from
" If it is a scientific article then, the first format is much more useful and to the point"
Much less fragmented and grouping of ideas was more meaningful - it was easy to digest information before making a leap from one node to another
 I was very distracted by the structure and had to spare much energy to simply make sense of the sentences
" For Passage 2, I clearly feel missing details about the relationship between son and mother and details about the show she went to"
 I like having everything separated for me
" For the other passage, it broke it down into notes too much, so it was more difficult to ""read"" it in a smooth way"
"  The second one felt like it presented a more complete, coherent picture of the passage than the first"
"For scientific knowledge that's linear, cause-and-effect, and more compartmentalized, a flowchart seems to be a natural visualization of such a thing"
 Passage 1 seemed easier as it was straightforward reading as opposed to Passage 2 which was more of a sprawling web of words
" For example, when studying for my college biology course, I used a study method similar to Passage 1's format; I had a main idea and then I connected other ideas"
 I can see this format being helpful for learning a new language because it gives you a path to follow
 The first format is helpful when there is a need to understand the narrator's points of view where the information is delivered in full sentences
" The main downfall of passage 2 is that its structure seems distracting at first glance, but once the structure is obtained it would seem more clear"
" You may find the correct path immediately, or you will have to run into several dead ends first"
" The format was also sometimes distracting and I found myself looking back on what I had just read, more often than I did during passage 1"
"I think that while passage 2 highlighted the important information required to answer the questions, the widespread format of information throughout the different links made it complicated to look back on other parts of information"
 Passage 1 required more effort through clicking and re-orienting oneself with complicated trees
It was easier to read because you didn't have to move your eyes across the page to take in the information
 Passage 2 presents all the necessary information succinctly in one page
"Passage 2 was easier, just due to being formatted in a more typical way than Passage 1"
 Passage 2 would be better for History and Science when discussing timeline or cause and effect
I retained the information better and could remember it visually the way it was displayed
"I preferred this format for it's higher level of flow, details, and context"
 It was quicker and easier to understand the information because it was only the key points with arrows pointing to other phrases of relatable and connecting information
" However, a story based article that focuses more on emotions and subjective experience is more helpful when given in the second usual format"
" Although I liked the categorization used in Passage 1, having to go back and forth from the main page to each topic made it slightly more difficult"
" Passage 1 would be good for things with a lot of content like maybe physics, math, chemistry, etc"
" Passage 2, although harder to read, would be more easily recalled in a content-addressed manner--that is, not completely in free writing but given the prompts in multiple-choice questions"
"

If a person has some level of prior knowledge about a topic, passage 1 method is useful to learn since the flowchart method makes it easy to search and find correct details but for completely new people, passage 2 might be more comfortable to a little extent"
 Passage 1 would most be helpful for history
I liked how it was less choppy and explained the story chronologically instead of having brief statements
" For impromptu speaking and speech-giving, Passage 2 would probably help me most, while for writing an essay or taking a memorization-based test, Passage 1 might be preferable for me"
" 
Passage one helped because the map at times was easier to follow therefore I got less confused"
" Passage 1 was also easy to read and fun to track through, but I would say it gave me a more general understanding mostly memorizing terms rather than comprehending the big picture"
" Passage 1 would be better for History, English, and Social Sciences when more detail is needed in order to gain a complete picture of the topic"
" Additionally, the formatting of passage 1 was often confusing and the short answers made the information a bit vague"
" Having to click back and forth in Passage 2, with very short and limited bits of information, was more challenging because it wasn't as easy to follow, nor did it feel as comprehensive"
it was in complete sentences and there were less arrows connecting the information so it was easier to follow 
 I liked being able to just follow the line(diagram) to the information that I needed
 Using a flow chart was a bit jarring and it felt more difficult to locate the necessary information
