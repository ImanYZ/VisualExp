The two formats are helpful in different contexts and for different purposes.

For the representation format of passage 1, it trains the ability to summarize information and find the logic chain between paragraphs. This might make the reading process more frustrated at the beginning - since the reader needs to figure out and summarize a lot of things by themselves.

====================================

Some other thoughts:
The two formats are helpful in different contexts and for different purposes.

For the representation format of passage 1, it trains the ability to summarize information and find the logic chain between paragraphs. This might make the reading process more frustrated at the beginning - since the reader needs to figure out and summarize a lot of things by themselves. But I believe this will ultimately improve their ability in seizing information and grow my reading skills. This is more like a student context, like for students before the undergraduate study (?)."
