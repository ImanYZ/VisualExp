    "text": "For the barn owl life depends on hearing. A nocturnal hunter, the bird must be able to find field mice solely by the rustling and squeaking sounds they make as they traverse runways in snow or grass. Like predators that hunt on the ground, the barn owl must be able to locate its prey quickly and precisely in the horizontal plane. Since the bird hunts from the air, it must also be able to determine its angle of elevation above the animal it is hunting. The owl has solved this problem very successfully: it can locate sounds in azimuth (the horizontal dimension) and elevation (the vertical dimension) better than any other animal whose hearing has been tested.    What accounts for this acuity? The answer lies in the owl’s ability to utilize subtle differences between the sound in its left ear and that in its right. The ears are generally at slightly different distances from the source of a sound, so that sound waves reach them at slightly different times. The barn owl is particularly sensitive to these minute differences, exploiting them to determine the azimuth of the sound. In addition, the sound is perceived as being somewhat louder by the ear that is closer to the source, and this difference offers further clues to horizontal location. For the barn owl the difference in loudness also helps to specify elevation because of an unusual asymmetry in the owl’s ears. The right ear and its opening are directed slightly upward; the left ear and its opening are directed downward. For this reason, the right ear is more sensitive to sounds from above and the left ear to sounds from below.    These differences in timing and loudness provide enough information for the bird to accurately locate sounds both horizontally and vertically. To be of service to the owl, however, the information must be organized and interpreted. Much of the processing is accomplished in brain centers near the beginning of the auditory pathway. From these centers nerve impulses travel to a network of neurons in the midbrain that are arranged in the form of a map of space. Each neuron in this network is excited only by sounds from one small region of space. From this structure impulses are relayed to the higher brain centers. The selection of sensory cues and their transformation into a map of space is what enables the barn owl to locate its prey in total darkness with deadly accuracy.    The most visually striking anatomical feature of the barn owl, and the one that plays the most important role in its location of prey, is the face. The skull is relatively narrow and small, and the face is large and round, made up primarily of layers of stiff, dense feathers arrayed in tightly packed rows. The feathered structure, called the facial ruff, forms a surface that is a very efficient reflector of high-frequency sounds.    Two troughs run through the ruff from the forehead to the lower jaw, each about two centimeters wide and nine centimeters long. The troughs are similar in shape to the fleshy exterior of the human ear, and they serve the same purpose: to collect high-frequency sounds from a large volume of space and funnel them into the ear canals. The troughs join below the beak. The ear openings themselves are hidden under the preaural flaps: two flaps of skin that project to the side next to the eyes. The entire elaborate facial structure is hidden under a layer of particularly fine feathers that are acoustically transparent.    The barn owl is capable of locating the source of a sound within a range of one to two degrees in both azimuth and elevation; one degree is about the width of a little finger at arm’s length. Surprisingly, until the barn owl was tested, man was the species with the greatest known ability to locate the source of a sound; human beings are about as accurate as the owl in azimuth but are three times worse in elevation.    The sensitivity of the barn owl’s hearing is shown both by its capacity to locate distant sounds and by its ability to orient its talons for the final strike. When the owl swoops down on a mouse, even in a completely dark experimental chamber, it quickly aligns its talons with the body axis of the mouse. This behavior is not accidental. When the mouse turns and runs in a different direction, the owl realigns its talons accordingly. This behavior clearly increases the probability of a successful strike; it also implies that the owl not only identifies the location of the sound source with extreme accuracy but also detects subtle changes in the origin of the sound from which it infers the direction of movement of the prey.",

    "text": "We met—Reena and myself—at the funeral of her aunt who had been my godmother and whom I had also called aunt, Aunt Vi, and loved, for she and her house had been, respectively, a source of understanding and a place of calm for me as a child. Reena entered the church where the funeral service was being held as though she, not the minister, were coming to officiate, sat down among the immediate family up front, and turned to inspect those behind her. I saw her face then.  It was a good copy of the original. The familiar mold was there, that is, and the configuration of bone beneath the skin was the same despite the slight fleshiness I had never seen there before, her features had even retained their distinctive touches: the positive set to her mouth, the assertive lift to her nose, the same insistent, unsettling eyes which when she was angry became as black as her skin—and this was total, unnerving, and very beautiful. Yet something had happened to her face. It was different despite its sameness. Aging even while it remained enviably young. Time had sketched in, very lightly, the evidence of the twenty years.  Her real name had been Doreen, a standard for girls among West Indians (her mother, like my parents, was from Barbados), but she had changed it to Reena on her twelfth birthday—”As a present to myself”—and had enforced the change on her family by refusing to answer to the old name. “Reena. With two e’s!” she would say and imprint those e’s on your mind with the indelible black of her eyes and a thin threatening finger that was like a quill.  She and I had not been friends through our own choice. Rather, our mothers, who had known each other since childhood, had forced the relationship. And from the beginning, I had been at a disadvantage. For Reena, as early as the age of twelve, had had a quality that was unique, superior, and therefore dangerous. She seemed defined, even then, all of a piece, the raw edges of her adolescence smoothed over; indeed, she seemed to have escaped adolescence altogether and made one dazzling leap from childhood into the very arena of adult life. At thirteen, for instance, she was reading Zola, Hauptmann, Steinbeck, while I was still in the thrall of the Little Minister and Lorna Doone. When I could only barely conceive of the world beyond Brooklyn, she was talking of the Civil War in Spain, lynchings in the South, Hitler in Poland—and talking with the outrage and passion of a revolutionary. I would try, I remember, to console myself with the thought that she was really an adult masquerading as a child, which meant that I could not possibly be her match.  For her part, Reena put up with me and was, by turns, patronizing and impatient. I merely served as the audience before whom she rehearsed her ideas and the yardstick by which she measured her worldliness and knowledge.   “Do you realize that this stupid country supplied Japan with the scrap iron to make the weapons she’s now using against it?” she had shouted at me once.   I had not known that.  Just as she overwhelmed me, she overwhelmed her family, with the result that despite a half dozen brothers and sisters who consumed quantities of bread and jam whenever they visited us, she behaved like an only child and got away with it. Her father, a gentleman with skin the color of dried tobacco and with the nose Reena had inherited jutting out like a crag from his nondescript face, had come from Georgia and was always making jokes about having married a foreigner—Reena’s mother being from the West Indies. When not joking, he seemed slightly bewildered by his large family and so in awe of Reena that he avoided her. Reena’s mother, a small, dry, formidably black woman, was less a person to me than the abstract principle of force, power, energy. She was alternately strict and indulgent with Reena and, despite the inconsistency, surprisingly effective.",

    "text": "“Now...this” is commonly used on the radio and television newscasts to indicate that what one has just heard or seen has no relevance to what one is about to hear or see, or possibly to anything one is ever likely to hear or see. The phrase is a means of acknowledging that fact that the world as mapped by the speeded-up electronic media has no order or meaning and it is not to be taken seriously. There is no murder so brutal, no earthquakes so devastating, no political blunder so costly--for that matter, no ball score so tantalizing or weather report so threatening--that it cannot be erased from our minds by a newscaster saying, “Now...this.” The newscaster means that you have thought long enough on the previous matter (approximately 45 seconds), that you must not be morbidly preoccupied with it (let us say, for 90 seconds), and that you must now give your attention to another fragment of news or a commercial.   Television did not invent the “Now...this” worldview. As I have tried to show, it is the offspring of the intercourse between telegraphy and photography. But it is through television that it has been nurtured and brought to a perverse maturity. For on television, nearly every half hour is a discrete event, separated in content, context, and emotional texture from what precedes and follows it. In part because television sell its time in seconds and minutes, in part because television must use images rather than words, in part because its audiences can move freely to and from the television set, programs are structured so that almost each eight-minute segment may stand as a complete event in itself. Viewers are rarely required to carry over any thought or feeling from one parcel of time to another.  Of course, in television’s presentation of the “new of the day,” we may see the “Now...this” mode of discourse in its boldest and most embarrassing form. For there, we are presented not only with fragmented news but news without context, without consequences, without value, and therefore without essential seriousness; that is to say, news as pure entertainment.  Consider for example, how you would proceed if you were given the opportunity to produce a television news show for any station concerned to attract the largest possible audience. You would, first, choose a cast of players, each of whom has a face that is both “likable” and “credible.” Those who apply would in fact, submit to you their eight-by-ten glossies, from which you would eliminate those whose countenances are not suitable for nightly display. This means that you will exclude women who are not beautiful or who are over the age of 50, men who are bald, all people who are overweight or those whose noses are too long or whose eyes are too close together. You will try, in other words, to assemble a cast of talking hairdos. At the very least, you will want those whose faces would not be unwelcome on a magazine cover.  Christine Craft has just such a face, and so she applied for co-anchor position on KMBC-TV in Kansas City. According to a lawyer who represented her in a sexism suit she later brought against the station, the management of KMBC-TV “loved Christine's look.\" She was accordingly hired in January 1981. She was fired in August 1981 because research indicated that her appearance “hampered viewer acceptance.” What exactly does “hampered viewer acceptance'' mean? And what does it have to do with the news? Hampered viewer acceptance means the same thing for television news as it does for any television show: Viewers do not like looking at the performer. It also means that viewers do not believe the performer, that she lacks credibility. In the case of a theatrical performance, we have a sense of what that implies: the actor does not persuade the audience that he or she is the character being portrayed. But what does lack of credibility imply in the case of a new show? What character is a co-anchor playing? And how do we decide the performance lacks verisimilitude? Does the audience believe that the newscaster is lying, that what is being reported did not in fact happen? That something important is being concealed?  Is it frightening to think that this may be so, that the perception of the truth of a report rests heavily on the acceptability of the newscaster? In the ancient world, there was a tradition of banishing or killing the bearer of bad tidings. Does the television news show restore, in a curious form, this tradition?",

    "text": "To the extent that it has a creator at all, the text message, or SMS (short message service), was created in the early 1980s by Friedhelm Hillebrand and Bernard Ghillebaert, who wanted to find a way to send data over the parts of phone lines that were not being used in normal telephony. The first text messages were 160 characters long. Hillebrand suggested that “160 characters was sufficient to express most messages succinctly,” citing typical postcard and Telex lengths.   Although this form might seem to limit the way we communicate, the text message is the most widely used data application in the world, with about 80% of all cellphone users (3.5 billion people) using the medium. Text messages are already a part of the cultural landscape: they are mentioned in rap and rock songs; they show up in billboards and advertisements selling just about anything; and they’ve even cropped up in serious novels like Jonathan Franzen’s Freedom and David Foster Wallace’s The Pale King. Text messages, in fact, move the whole plot of Martin Scorsese’s 2006 film The Departed, a critical success and eventual Oscar winner for Best Picture.   But the text message is more than a cultural fad. It’s part of a broader shift in the way we connect with one another. Speaking on an actual telephone is basically defunct in 2013, not only for the economic reason that “time is money” and a text is quicker than a call, but also for a much older desire in all of us for permanence. With a text message, we’ve got a record of all our communications, and although we may cast them off quickly, even the shortest text message requires more pre-thought than a verbalized remark: we can’t go back to our recorded calls, but our texts live on our phones for as long as we choose to keep them there. The text message has made even our most fleeting conversations permanent - and in this way, the text harkens back to one of the earliest modes of communication, even before the telephone: the letter.   Although America was a sprawling, disparate place even before the War for Independence in the 1770s, its residents always felt the need to communicate with those farther and farther away. Ships carried people back and forth across the Atlantic Ocean, but they also carried correspondence, and we could even say that our very nation was founded in these written communiqués: much of what we know about the era comes from these letters. One day, text messages may provide a similar record of our own moment.   But it would be naïve to say that these quick notes are anything like the voluminous correspondence of ages past. In her recent monograph Write Me a Letter, Kari Fields wonders if the sophisticated concentration of that historical correspondence is even available to us anymore. Fields warns not only that we may have been “dumbed down” by our technologies but also that we may have lost one of the essential elements of the human experience. “The content of our communication with each other (‘I’ll be late to work today’; ‘I’ll be home at 10’; or even, ‘I love you’) may ultimately be the same,” Fields concedes, “but the real communication lives in the form - the tone, the unsteady hand on a particular word, the hasty erasures.” Perhaps Fields herself is missing the point: naysayers have said that everything from the printing press, to the radio, to the movie screen, to Google, has compromised the way we think and understand. It makes no difference whether a letter takes a month by boat, two weeks by Pony Express, a few days by post, or a few seconds by email. The medium, it seems safe to say, is not the message.   However, Fields is aware of all these earlier changes. She is as sophisticated a historian of these media as anyone working in the field today. We cannot deny that text messages and the Internet have isolated us from one another like never before. In addition to placing us alone at our computers or on our phones, these new technologies also force us to spread our limited attention spans thinner and thinner. We may have to think about the text messages we send, but we typically do so while looking at something else on the web, listening to music or podcasts, or seconds before or after sending messages to someone else. It’s not merely that our communications are getting shorter and shorter; it’s that the time we have for real interactions has shrunk. All of these new devices are supposed to be time-savers, but what they’ve really given us is more time to use the devices, to the point that a year without seeing a dear friend seems less daunting than a few hours without the phone. Still, text messages may be our last, best surrogate for the intimacy of “real” communication. As Herberth Chacon observes in I Like You...on Facebook, “Whatever the limitations of this new medium of communication, people are interacting on a day-to-day basis with more people than their ancestors might have met in a lifetime.” Text messages have gained such currency because, for all their flaws, they do bring us together. After all, even if the words “I love you” are flashing up impersonally on a screen - stripped of all tone and affection - the words are nice to hear nonetheless, and even if our new definition of “friends” may not square with the old definition, it’s nice to know there’s a world out there that’s paying attention to us.",

    "text": "Near the end of his eight years as a recording-session musician, tenor saxophonist Leon “Chu” Berry landed a short-lived spot with Count Basie’s orchestra. Standing in for one of the basie band’s two tenor giants, Berry took a lead solo on “Oh, Lady, Be Good,” the 1924 Gershwin song that Basie had played for years. In the 28 seconds that the solo lasted on February 4, 1939, we were treated to no less than the musical personification of mind and body working together in divine musical tandem. When you hear the recording for the first time, you’re likely to wonder why you’ve never heard of Chu Berry before.  Why you’ve never heard of him is pretty simple: a lot of hard-core jazz buffs don’t know much about him. Berry was a solid session player who turns up on recordings with Basie, Bessie Smith, Fletcher Henderson, and Billie Holiday. But he did not cut many sessions himself as a leader, and when he soloed, he worked within the recording constraints of the era and the swing genre - fast-moving 78s with solos often lasting for a mere 32 beats.   The people who loved Berry were, not surprisingly, other tenor players, a situation leading to the dreaded “musician’s musician” tag. But that’s not nearly enough praise enough to describe Chu Berry, who, when given opportunity, displayed a musical dexterity that would be envied by future generations of horn men.         Berry faced the lot of other horn players: having to grind it out long and hard until something memorable burst through: the prejudices and expectations of the listening public: and the accepted wisdom of what is and isn’t art in a given medium. In this case, swing was fodder for dance parties, not music worthy of study.     Oddly enough, Berry’s geniality might have helped explain his failure to court history’s favor: it wasn’t in his nature to call attention to himself or his playing. Born in 1908 into the black middle class in Wheeling, West Virginia, the laid-back, affable Berry attended West Virginia State in Charleston, where he switched from alto sax to tenor and exhibited the willingness to fit in that characterized his presence in so many dance bands. He was the rare artist who refused to put his interests above those of the band, even if it meant playing ensemble passages rather than taking a healthy allotment of solo breaks.      College provided a training ground for Berry the bandsman, as he teamed up with a number of amateur outfits. He never played simply to show off. Instead, he tried to bring out the positive attributes in any given situation or setting. Later, when Berry is performing with the Calloway ensemble, we hear some ragged, out-of-tune playing until Berry’s first few solo notes emerge. The other players, no longer languidly lowing through their charts, immediately surge up behind him, all fighting-fit. Once Berry finishes his solo, the shenanigans resume.    After making his way to New York, Berry immediately became a presence and soon was in demand. The great jazz orchestras of the swing era were fronted by musical directors/arrangers - Duke Ellington was preeminent - who drew the acclaim. The sidemen were musical traveling salesmen who sold someone else’s wares in the best style they could manage. It was some of the sideman’s subservient trappings. For starters, Henderson wrote in keys that were rare for the jazz orchestra of the day, and his somber, indigo-inflected voicings were ideal for a player of Berry’s introspective approach to his instrument: Berry sounds as if he’s being swallowed by his sax. “Blues in C Sharp Minor,” for instance, is odd, haunting, and ultimately relaxing. A Berry solo in it is slightly off mike, making the listener feel as though he’s been playing for some time before we finally hear him. The effect is unnerving, as if we weren’t paying close attention.      In June 1940, Cab Calloway granted Berry a show-case piece. “A Ghost of a Chance,” the solo recording in Berry’s career to feature him from start to finish. It was his “Body and Soul,” a response to Coleman Hawkin’s famous recording, intended not as a riposte to a rival, but as the other half of a dialogue. Its rubato lines are disembodied from the music meant to accompany it, which is spartan to begin with. This may be Berry’s one and only instance of indulgence on a record, a cathedral of a solo in its flourishes, angles, ornamentations, reflexivity. If sunlight could pass through music, “A Ghost of a Chance” would funnel it out in the broadest spectrum of colors.",

    "text": "Recently I was reminded of just how powerful ants can be when inflicting damage on intruders. A team of biomechanists has studied the incredibly speedy bite of a group of Central and South American ants. The team clocked the bite as the fastest on the planet—and discovered that it also gives the ants the unique ability to jump with their jaws, adding to an impressive array of already known defenses.  Trap-jaw ants nest in leaf litter, rather than underground or in mounds. There they often feed on well-armored and elusive prey, including other species of ants. As they stalk their dinner, the trap-jaws hold their mandibles wide apart, often cocked open at 180 degrees or more by a latch mechanism. When minute trigger hairs on the inner edge of the mandible come in contact with something, the jaws snap shut at speeds now known to reach 145 miles per hour. No passerby could outrace that. The astoundingly high speed gives the jaws, despite their light weight, enough force to crack open the armor of most prey and get at the tasty meat inside.  The key to the jaws’ speed (and their even more amazing acceleration) is that the release comes from stored energy produced by the strong but slow muscles of the jaw. Think how an archer slowly draws an arrow in a bowstring against the flex of a bow: nearly all the energy from the archer’s muscles pours into the flexing of the bow. When released, the energy stored in the bow wings the arrow toward its target much faster than the archer could by throwing the arrow like a javelin. The biomechanics of energy storage is the domain of Sheila N. Patek and Joseph E. Baio, both biomechanists at the University of California, Berkeley. They teamed up with two ant experts, Brian L. Fisher of the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco and Andrew V. Suarez of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, to look at the trap-jaw ant Odontomachus bauri.  Fisher, Suarez, and other field biologists had already noted that catching O. bauri was like grabbing for popping popcorn—and very hot popcorn at that, because a painful sting goes with an ant’s trap-jaw bite. The insects bounced around in a dizzying frenzy and propelled themselves many times their body length when biologists or smaller intruders approached them. Patek and Baio made high-speed video images of their movements, and discovered that the secret of their self-propulsion was the well-executed “firing” of their mandibles. They also observed that mandibles started to decelerate before they meet—possibly to avoid self-inflicted damage. Most important, the ants had two distinct modes of aerial locomotion.   In the so-called escape jump, an ant orients its head and jaws perpendicular to the ground, then slams its face straight down. That triggers the cocked mandibles to release with a force 400 times the ant’s body weight, launching the insect ten or more body lengths nearly straight into the air. The ant doesn’t seem to go in any particular direction, but the jump is presumably fast and unpredictable enough to help the insect evade, say, the probing tongue of a lizard. Not only can the jumping ant gain height and sow confusion, but it may also get to a new vantage point from which to relaunch an attack.  The second kind of jaw-propelled locomotion is even more common than escape jumping. If an intruder enters the ants’ nest, one of the ants bangs its jaws against the intruder, which triggers the trap-jaw and propels the interloper (if small enough) in one direction, out of the nest, and the ant in the other. Often the force sends the ant skimming an inch off the ground for nearly a foot. The attack, for obvious reasons, is known as the “bouncer defense.” In the wild, gangs of defending ants team up to attack hostile strangers, sending them head over heels out of the nest.   From an evolutionary point of view, the trap-jaws are an intriguing story. The ants clearly evolved an entirely new function, propulsion, for a system that was already useful—chewing up prey. Several lineages of trap-jaw ants have independently hit on the tactic of storing energy in their jaws to penetrate well-defended prey. In Odontomachus, the horizontal, bouncer-defense jump could have arisen out of attempts to bite intruders, but the high, escape jump—with jaws aimed directly at the ground—must have arisen from a different, perhaps accidental kind of behavior. Such a serendipitous event would have been a rare instance in which banging one’s head against the ground got good results.",

    "text": "After the revolution, her life had become different in many ways, but the ballet was the thing that stood out in vivid color among her faded black-and-white memories of early childhood. Going to school was strange enough. Her older sister hadn't gone, because girls didn't, and her brother didn't, because they couldn't afford the fees. Under the new regime, however, not just poor children, but even poor girls went to school.   Nevertheless, school was at least something she had known about. That cold, bright day in January of 1967, when she boarded a rusty, sputtering bus for a class field trip to the Palace of the Galician Centre to see Alicia Alonso dance Giselle, felt like a rebirth to her, as if she were emerging from her cocoon into a new and bigger world. She couldn't believe she was going to actually walk into such a stately building, and was half-afraid that the marble statues keeping watch over the entrance would come to life and forbid her to enter. Enter she did though, and the grandness of the interior forced her into a hush, as if she were in the Cathedral, not a theater. She tried to walk quietly, but her hard-soled school shoes insisted on asserting their presence on the shiny floor and the immense marble staircase that curved insistently upward, seemingly to heaven.   Years later, Isabel Moreno would go to that theater many times, confidently clicking her high-heeled shoes on the same staircase, but that day as a schoolgirl, she hadn't known such places existed. She sat gingerly on the edge of her seat, afraid to lean back into the luxurious plush red upholstery. Then, when the music started and the dancers appeared, she couldn't lean back because she was so mesmerized by what was happening on stage. The elegance of the ballerinas in their pointe shoes was unlike anything she had seen; the dancers' movements, impeccably controlled and flawlessly in time with the music, transported Isabel to the joyful and yearning world of peasant girls celebrating the bountiful harvest and young love. She knew those feelings, but had never been able to imagine or express them as perfectly as the dancers did.   After the performance, Isabel had begged her mother to let her try out for the ballet school—she felt as though her life would never have meaning unless she could be one of those dancers on stage. She wasn't accepted, and wept for weeks afterwards. Even as an adult, every time she went to the ballet she felt that overwhelming sadness again that became so powerful it felt strangely joyful. The pas de deux of Siegfried and Odette in Act 2 of Swan Lake seemed to her a more truthful presentation of the awakening of love than anything she would experience in real life. When Cinderella had to leave the ball at the end of Act 2 for fear of being discovered as her dress turned back to rags, Isabel felt keenly the anxiety of living a relatively comfortable life, so far removed from the poverty of her childhood.   Isabel's son, Alejandro, had been trying to get her to come visit Miami for years, but she had never accepted, claiming that the paperwork was too complicated, that she couldn't take the time off from the hospital. Alejandro had tried to entice his mother with visits to the Miami Ballet, but Isabel wasn't interested. The dancers in Miami weren't as good as the Cuban dancers, she'd say. Eventually, Alejandro realized he had to tempt her with something she couldn't see in Havana. When he called Isabel to say he had purchased tickets to see Mikhail Baryshnikov in Miami, it was if she were the mechanical doll Coppéllia suddenly brought to life. She needed to see the legendary Russian dancer who had defected from the Soviet Union and abandoned classical ballet for modern dance with a fierceness that overcame her hesitations about paperwork and vacation time.   The program started with a short solo dance by Baryshnikov, and he was a marvel of unassuming, fluid grace. Isabel had often thought that male dancers were too assertively athletic, that the ballerinas were the real stars of the show. But that evening, in that short, simple dance, Isabel understood that the classical Cuban ballet she so loved was only one small part of the expressive possibility of dance. She was transported back to that first day at the ballet when she was a schoolgirl, and she felt that same sense of wonder that she hadn't known about this heartbreakingly beautiful art form before. When the first dance ended, she was too stunned to clap. Alejandro touched her arm lightly, worried that Isabel hadn't liked it. After a moment, Isabel turned to her son, tears now leaking out of the corners of her eyes, and embraced him warmly. \"Gracias, mi hijo,\" she whispered, \"thank you, my son.\"",

    "text": "Dr. Dajun Wang has learned to walk a fine line between advocating for wildlife habitat conservation and advocating for zoos. Wang has spent hours in the mountains of western China, tracking the giant panda, one of the most endangered, elusive, and beloved creatures in the world. As a conservation biologist, his ultimate goal is to preserve species in the wild, and animal rights activists say that confining animals in zoos runs counter to this philosophy. In recent years, critics have attacked zoos for spending huge sums of money on breeding endangered species such as giant pandas in captivity while little is being done to stem the tide of habitat destruction in the wild. At the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., the latest product of these breeding efforts, a 4-month-old giant panda named Bao Bao, is now on view to the public, and her fuzzy baby antics are attracting so many visitors that the zoo has extended its weekend hours to accommodate them all. The pandas at the National Zoo are easy for visitors to see, thanks to the 2006 opening of a 12,000 square foot, state-of-the-art habitat. Wang sees this new habitat as part of a positive trend in zoo design, with new elements that are making a difference in conservation. As the National Zoo was preparing to build its new panda habitat, landscape designers were consulted with researchers, including Wang, to learn what the animals need to stay comfortable, happy, and engaged. The new exhibit closely mimics the pandas’ natural habitat, and is more interactive for visitors than was the small, spare one originally built in the 70s for the zoo’s first pair of pandas, Hsing Hsing and Ling Ling. Visitors to the new exhibit can try out some of the same features the pandas enjoy, such as a cooling rock that has cold water piped through it to keep the bears comfortable during hot weather, a panda grotto, and a fog grove. What Wang likes best about the exhibit, however, are the Decision Stations that teach visitors about habit loss and conservation efforts. His research has shown that human development, which has shrunk the pandas’ natural habitat and broken it up into small parcels, is the main threat to the bears’ survival in the wild. The Decision Stations give visitors a taste of what it’s like to weight economic decisions against the need to preserve panda habitats, and Wang says this experience helps them understand that the problem is a wider socio-economic one that biologists can’t solve on their own. Wang is concerned about all the animals affected by habitat loss, not just giant pandas, and he understands the argument of the growing number of critics who say that the focus on pandas means that too much money is being spent on a single species. However, he’s also quick to point out the importance of animals such as pandas that can serve as ambassadors for conservation. The giant panda is an example of what scientists call “charismatic megafauna”. Because of its universal appeal, it was chosen as the icon for the World Wildlife Federation, and has become a symbol for endangered species worldwide. “In Chinese culture, pandas have long been symbols of peace and diplomacy,” says Wang. He sees their role within the animal kingdom in the same way. Just as gifts of pandas have helped China negotiate diplomatic relations in years past, so too the bears now bring attention to conservation issues, and the money and research that they generate benefit other species as well. Panda conservation funds have made possible the construction of “corridors” of wild land that connect isolated remaining parcels of habitat, providing the pandas with better access to land, as well as to each other. In recent years, the wild panda population has begun to increase, indicating that the corridors are working. The corridors have also helped the snow leopard, another endangered species that shares the panda’s habitat. Wang characterizes the corridors as rivers, where water can easily flow, instead of isolated ponds that are constantly in danger of drying out. The panda’s black and white fur is understood in China to be a physical manifestation of the idea of yin and yang, the balance of positive and negative energy in the world. Wang sees this idea as also integral to find balance between spending money on breeding cute baby pandas and addressing the underlying human behaviors that have endangered the panda in the first place. Even Wang is not immune, though, to the charms of the giant pandas he studies. He is best known among the general public for a YouTube video in which he plays with a panda cub whose mother he had been tracking. The mother panda got so accustomed to Wang following her that on one occasion she left him in charge of her cub while she went to feed. One of Wang’s colleagues captured the remarkable event on video. Though babysitting panda cubs isn’t the focus of Wang’s research, he doesn’t mind the attention he’s received from the video. “That was the best time in my life,” he says. ",
