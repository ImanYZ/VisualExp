          We are an interdisciplinary group of learners and researchers who have
          been iteratively contributing to and improving a large-scale, online
          collaborative research platform called 1Cademy. Our platform
          facilitates knowledge sharing and remote, collaborative research by
          enabling users to organize research in a hierarchical format through
          content generation, mapping, and evaluation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main objective of the Positive Psychology community is to explore
          three fundamental lines of inquiry of the discipline which includes
          positive subjective experiences, individual traits, and social
          institutions. A focus will be on the efficacy of mindfulness practices
          within the clinical context. Interns will have the freedom to research
          a topic of interest within positive psychology and share their
          findings on the collaborative research platform 1Cademy.
        </p>
        <p>Some of the topics such as the following will be discussed:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Impact of positive experiences such as love, good mood, and
            happiness on the wellbeing of individuals and its buffering effect
            on psychopathology.
          </li>
          <li>
            The power of social support on individuals and its relation to
            psychological nurturement.
          </li>
          <li>

    We have compiled an inclusive list of mental disorders from the DSM-5 that can benefit from clinical mindfulness as well as documented case studies of certain populations that were able to benefit from mindfulness when it applied to psychopathological symptoms.
    We have outlined multiple mindfulness interventions that have been backed by empirical research and heavily tested across the world in multiple research institutions.
    Also, we have connected the origins of mindfulness that stemmed from eastern traditions to the current applications of mindfulness in the clinical western setting as well as provided a cohesive snapshot of the roots of mindfulness in ancient eastern religions.`,

    description: `Welcome to the Deep Learning Community! Our community predominantly contributes to the deep learning area on 1Cademy, our collaborative research platform. This semester, we will explore natural language processing, which is a branch of artificial intelligence concerned with giving computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can. Our team members will dive into the Speech and Language Processing textbook and present what they've been learning throughout each week by walking us through the nodes they have designed during our weekly team meetings. After meeting certain requirements, you will be invited to join our small research group to work on concrete research ideas.`,
    accomplishments: `In our research teams, we work on versatile projects, share our ideas, and collaboratively develop research ideas that not only boost our knowledge in deep learning but also give us the possibility to publish research papers in the most prestigious conferences and journals.
