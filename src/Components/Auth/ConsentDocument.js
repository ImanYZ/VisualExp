      <p>
        You are invited to participate in a research study to investigate the
        effect of different knowledge visualization formats on reading
        comprehension and learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to participate in the study, you must have access to a laptop
        or desktop computer with fast and reliable internet connection.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you agree to be part of the research study, you will be asked to
        attend a recorded one-on-one online interview session where the
        interviewer asks the interviewee to share their screen to show them how
        they answer different types of questions on our experiment webpage and
        explain their answers to each question.
      </p>
      <p>This study includes three sessions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The first session takes approximately an hour</li>
        <li>The second session takes approximately 30 minutes</li>
        <li>The third session takes approximately 30 minutes</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There are no risks, however, you will be asked to share your screen to
        present how you read the passages and answer questions, and talk
        throughout the recorded interview.
      </p>
      <p>There is no compensation for participation in this research.</p>
      <p>
        Participating in this study is completely voluntary. Even if you decide
        to participate now, you may change your mind and stop at any time. You
        may choose not to answer any or request to pause or stop the interview
        for any reason.
      </p>
      <p>We will not collect any sensitive or identifiable information.</p>
      <p>
        Information collected in this project may be shared with other
        researchers, but we will not share any information that could identify
        you.
      </p>
