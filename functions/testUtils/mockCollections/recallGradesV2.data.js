A panda named Bao Bao has drawn a lot of visitors to the zoo, and the zoo had to extend its hours to accommodate all the guests. The exhibit has a panda grove. Visitors can have an immersive experience at the exhibit and learn about the pandas' natural habitat. A criticism of Wang's research is that too much money is being spent on studying a single species. Wang witnessed a mother panda caring for its offspring and felt a sense of joy. ",

The exhibit contains a station where visitors can learn more about the pandas' natural habitat. Bao Bao is a panda at the exhibit that has drawn more visitors to the zoo. The zoo had to extend its hours in order to accommodate the increased number of guests. Critics of the panda exhibit say that too much money is being spent on a single exhibit and area of research. The exhibit includes a grotto for the pandas. ",
