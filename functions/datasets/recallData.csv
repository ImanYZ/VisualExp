0H30jIUz55vlgkNXZs3k,Barn owl hunts from air,"Owls locate sound vertically and horizontally, as they hunt from the air. Their physical structure helps them locate their prey, and any changes in sound. This is indicated by them adjusting their talons when a mouse changes position. Their face is visually striking, and has troughs that allow them to filter sound, and fine feathers that allow sound to pass through them. Different neurons indicate different areas of sound detected. While humans and owls are similarly skilled at horizontal sound detection, owls are 3x better at vertical sound detection.

yFZ9KOOClS5CaArrIwRj,Two troughs funnel high frequency sounds into ear canals,"Owls detect sound in the horizontal and vertical range, what helps them detect sound is when the sound reaches both ears additionally one is better for sounds above the owl and other ear is better for sounds below the owl, the sounds later then get processed in the mid brain, talons move, the owl's face is the most visually appealing as had , owls human same in azimuth but owl 3 time better in elevation,",6rc4k1su3txN6ZK4CJ0h,Tirdad Barghi,0,Jessica Cai,0,Ziyi Wang,0,Xiaowen Yuan,0,0
yGNsb3llXDIQuNDEYJpO,Human beings locating sound in azimuth have similar accuracy as barn owls,"Owls locate sound vertically and horizontally, as they hunt from the air. Their physical structure helps them locate their prey, and any changes in sound. This is indicated by them adjusting their talons when a mouse changes position. Their face is visually striking, and has troughs that allow them to filter sound, and fine feathers that allow sound to pass through them. Different neurons indicate different areas of sound detected. While humans and owls are similarly skilled at horizontal sound detection, owls are 3x better at vertical sound detection.

While it has similar horizontal skill to humans, it is three times better at locating sound vertically. The barn owl is able to locate changes in sound on the ground (e.g. a mouse moving position) and is able to adjust its talons accordingly so that it can catch the prey - this is done through its neurons. It has a visually striking face designed with two long troughs down the face and fine feathers that allow sound to pass through.

zJHVCZeen5c1SLep4jL9,Barn owl locates sounds in elevation (vertical dimension),"The barn owl first has amazing hunting capabilities. It is equipped with hearing that helps him see with his ears. The owl is able to change the direction of fight and flight without using its eyes. It is able to readjust its talons to where the prey is moving with these hearing capabilities. It has specific features on its face that channel sounds into his ears that are different than each other. One hears noises abobve and the other hears noises below. With these he is able to react quickly on the horizontal plane. His reaction time in the air is equal to that of a human but on the azimuth level it is three times a human. Because of this unique evolved skill set, he is able to survive in the habitat he was built for because of the prey that he targets.

zZJF6QKXrR4lIP88LceP,Sensitivity of the owl's hearing is shown by its ability to orient talons for final strike,"The barn owl detects sound on two plans - horizontal and vertical, as it hunts from the air. While it's horizontal abilities are similar to a human's, a barn owl is about 3x better at detecting sound from the air than a human is. Barn owls are able to detect small changes in their prey's movement and position from the air, which is demonstrated by how they readjust their talons. This is because different neurons are focused on different areas and changes in that area. Additionally, the owl has two troughs on its face (longer than wide) and fine feathers that allow sound to pass through them.
